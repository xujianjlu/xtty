//! Tracks the DEC private modes a pane's output has switched on, so a
//! re-attaching client can be told about them instead of having to find them
//! in the replayed bytes.
//!
//! A pane's screen comes back on re-attach as raw bytes out of the replay ring,
//! and the ring is a *window*: it holds the last few megabytes and drops the
//! rest from the front. That is fine for text, which is only worth what is
//! still on screen, and wrong for modes, which a full-screen program sets
//! exactly once — `btop` sends `?1049h` and its mouse modes at startup and then
//! never again, so a day of refreshes pushes the only copy of them out of the
//! ring. The client that replays what is left ends up painting an alternate
//! screen onto its primary buffer with mouse reporting off, and its wheel falls
//! back to scrolling the scrollback of a screen that should not scroll (#774).
//!
//! So the daemon folds the same bytes into this tracker as they pass, and
//! `replay_state` re-sends what is still on ahead of the ring — the same
//! treatment cwd, the prompt state and the agent already get. Only what the
//! ring itself no longer carries, though: see [`TerminalModes::restore_bytes_beyond`].
//!
//! Only modes that change how input is routed or which buffer is on screen are
//! tracked. Cursor visibility (`?25`) and autowrap (`?7`) are deliberately left
//! out: any frame of a running TUI paints them back within milliseconds, while
//! restoring them from a stale fold could leave a shell with an invisible
//! cursor, which is a worse failure than the one being fixed.

/// The modes worth restoring.
///
/// `47`, `1047` and `1049` are the alternate screen in its three spellings —
/// the mode the wheel consults before it decides the pane has a scrollback to
/// move at all, and the one that decides which buffer the replayed frames are
/// painted into. `1000`, `1002` and `1003` are the mouse reporting level and
/// `1005`, `1006`, `1015` and `1016` its encodings: a program that negotiated
/// SGR and comes back without it reads every wheel report as a click at a
/// wrong, truncated coordinate. `1007` is alternate scroll, which is what turns
/// the wheel into arrow keys inside a full-screen program, and `1` (DECCKM)
/// decides whether those arrows are `ESC O A` or `ESC [ A`. `1004` is focus
/// reporting, which the client stops sending without it, and `2004` bracketed
/// paste — without it a paste into a restored TUI arrives as plain keystrokes,
/// which is how a paste turns into commands.
