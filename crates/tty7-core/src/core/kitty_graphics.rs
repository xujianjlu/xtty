//! Streaming kitty-graphics-protocol extractor (APC `ESC _ G … ST`).
//!
//! The daemon-side counterpart to [`crate::core::osc`]: a tiny, resumable state
//! machine that pulls kitty graphics commands out of the raw PTY byte stream
//! *without* running a full VT parser. It exists for the same reason the OSC
//! sniffer does — the client's `alacritty_terminal` fork silently discards APC
//! sequences (`ESC _` routes to vte's `SosPmApcString`, whose payload bytes hit
//! a `_ => ()` arm), so an image transmitted this way never surfaces as a `Term`
//! event. We tap the bytes here instead.
//!
//! This lives daemon-side so the pixel payload can be lifted out of the stream
//! *before* it enters the replay ring — a full-window RGBA frame is hundreds of
//! KB, and letting it accumulate in the ring would make reattach replay
//! catastrophic. The daemon decodes here and forwards a compact out-of-band
//! frame to the client; the base64 text never rides the socket, and the VT
//! parser never has to chew through it.
//!
//! Scope: this handles the subset the wire actually carries in practice
//! (transmit-and-display, query, delete). Which transmission media we accept
//! depends on where the pane lives:
//!
//! - Direct (`t=d`, base64 inline) is always honored — it is the only medium
//!   that survives tty7's socket + SSH topology.
//! - File (`t=f`/`t=t`) and shared memory (`t=s`) are honored only on a *local*
//!   unix pane, where the name resolves on this host and the daemon can read it
//!   without anything crossing a tunnel. Everywhere else — a remote pane, or a
//!   non-unix host where [`MediumTransfer::resolve`] can't do the work — the
//!   probe is answered *unsupported* so a sender like `terminal-browser` falls
//!   back to `t=d` on its own rather than transmitting into a black hole.
//!
