//! A history file per pane, instead of one everybody writes into.
//!
//! Shells share history by sharing a file. Two panes running zsh with
//! `share_history`, or bash with `histappend`, are appending to the same
//! `~/.zsh_history` and reading each other's lines back — which is either the
//! feature or the problem, depending on what the panes are for. Someone with a
//! pane per task wants Up to walk *this* task's commands, not an interleaving
//! of four.
//!
//! So each pane gets its own file, named after the pane, and the shell is told
//! to use it. Two consequences follow from that being all it is:
//!
//! - **The pane does not start blank.** The file is seeded from whatever the
//!   shell's real history file was, so Up still reaches last week's commands.
//!   Only what is typed from now on stays local.
//! - **Nothing is lost when the pane closes.** What the pane added is appended
//!   back to the file it was seeded from. A per-pane history that evaporates
//!   would be a way of losing commands, not of organising them.
//!
//! The seeding is done by the shell rather than by the daemon, and that is the
//! only reason this works at all: the daemon cannot know where a given shell
//! keeps its history. `HISTFILE` is set by the user's rc file, to anywhere they
//! like, long after the pane's environment was decided. tty7's integration
//! snippet runs *after* that rc — it is appended to the rc it wraps — so it is
//! the one place where the real path is known. It copies the tail, records what
//! it copied, and repoints `HISTFILE`; this module only has to clean up.
//!
//! A shell with no tty7 integration is simply not covered: nothing sets the
//! variable, nothing reads it, and the pane keeps the history it always had.
