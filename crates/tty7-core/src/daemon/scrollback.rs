//! What a pane looked like, kept where the daemon's own death cannot reach it.
//!
//! The replay ring already holds every pane's recent output so a reattaching
//! client can be shown the screen it left. It holds it in this process, which
//! makes it exactly as durable as this process: a crash, a `kill -9`, or a
//! reboot takes the panes and their scrollback together, and the window comes
//! back to a row of blank shells with no trace of what was in them.
//!
//! The planned upgrade path does not lose anything — see `daemon::handoff`,
//! which carries the live ptys and their rings into the new binary without the
//! shells ever noticing. This module is for the paths a handoff cannot cover,
//! where the process does not get to run any code on its way out. It cannot
//! keep the *processes*; nothing written to a file can. It keeps the picture.
//!
//! Consequences of that being the goal:
//!
//! - **The snapshot is periodic, not write-through.** Every pty byte reaching
//!   the disk would be an enormous amount of write amplification to buy a few
//!   seconds of freshness at the tail of a crash. The writer runs on a timer
//!   and skips panes whose ring has not changed.
//! - **It is capped far below the ring.** [`SNAPSHOT_CAP`] keeps what fills a
//!   screen or two, not the ring's whole 8 MiB. The value of scrollback decays
//!   steeply with distance from the bottom, and every byte here is a byte of
//!   someone's terminal sitting on disk.
//! - **It is not asked for.** These bytes include whatever was echoed into the
//!   pane: tokens, `env` output, an agent's transcript. In memory they die
//!   with the daemon; on disk they outlive it, which is the whole point and
//!   also the whole risk. It was a setting once, defaulting to off. That was
//!   wrong about *when* the choice gets made: the moment anyone learns they
//!   wanted this is the moment a daemon has already died, and by then the
//!   switch could only be flipped for next time. A feature that exists to
//!   survive an unscheduled event cannot be opt-in. So the cost is paid for
//!   everyone, and the two bullets below are what keep it small.
//! - **It is dropped as soon as it is meaningless.** A pane that is closed, or
//!   that no workspace refers to any more, has its file removed. Retention is
//!   by relevance, not by calendar: a snapshot of a pane nobody will reopen is
//!   not worth keeping for a month, or for an hour.
