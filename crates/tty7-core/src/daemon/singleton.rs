//! One server per config directory, decided by the kernel.
//!
//! Two servers against one config dir is not a degraded mode, it is a silent
//! one. They do not fight over both endpoints — they split them. The one that
//! keeps `control.sock` answers `MachineGet` out of its own pane registry,
//! which is empty because the panes are all in the *other* process, so every
//! pane in the machine tree reads as dead. Nothing logs an error; the window
//! just quietly rebuilds every session it was asked to restore.
//!
//! That split was reachable because "is a server already running?" was answered
//! by connecting to its socket and treating one failed connect as proof of
//! death — after which the newcomer unlinked the endpoint and bound its own.
//! A connect can fail for a server that is merely slow to reach `accept`, and
//! the loser of that race never learns it was replaced: it holds a listener on
//! an unlinked path and serves nobody, forever.
//!
//! An advisory lock has no such gap. Holding it is the definition of being the
//! server, the kernel drops it when the holder dies however it dies, and there
//! is no stale state to interpret — which is the property the socket probe
//! could never have.
//!
//! Take it *before* either endpoint. Then a stale endpoint can only ever be
//! removed by a process that already knows it is alone, and the removal is safe
//! by construction rather than by timing.
