//! Replacing the daemon's binary without replacing the daemon.
//!
//! Every other way of upgrading the daemon ends with the shells dead, and not
//! by oversight. A pty's master is a file descriptor held by this process; when
//! this process goes, the descriptor closes, the slave side raises `SIGHUP`,
//! and everything in the pane goes with it. Storing state does not help — see
//! `daemon::scrollback`, which stores a great deal of it and still cannot bring
//! back a single process.
//!
//! `execve` is the exception. It replaces the *image* while keeping the
//! *process*: same pid, same children, same open descriptors — anything without
//! `FD_CLOEXEC` — same file locks, same signal mask, same session and process
//! group. So the ptys stay open, the shells never see a hangup, and the thing
//! that changes is only which code is on the other end of the descriptor.
//!
//! What that costs is that nothing in memory survives. Threads, the pane
//! registry, the rings, the client connections: all of it is gone the instant
//! `execve` succeeds. Whatever the new image needs, this one has to write down
//! first and pass along by descriptor number.
//!
//! The blob is written to a file that is unlinked before a byte goes into it,
//! so it has no name for anything to read and the kernel frees it when the last
//! descriptor closes. That matters here: it holds every pane's ring, which is
//! the same terminal output `scrollback` makes people opt in to storing. A
//! handoff should not be a way to write it to disk behind their back.
//!
//! Not everything can cross:
//!
//! - **Native SSH panes.** Their session is a cipher state and a set of tasks
//!   in this process's memory. The socket descriptor would survive, but nothing
//!   that knows how to speak on it would. They are hung up before the exec, so
//!   the far end sees a clean disconnect rather than a stalled connection.
//! - **Client connections.** A window is holding a socket to us; that socket
//!   dies with the image. Clients reconnect and reattach by pane id, which is
//!   the path they already use after any restart — except that this time the
//!   attach finds the pane alive, with its ring and its running program.
//! - **Windows.** There is no `execve`, and a ConPTY's pseudoconsole handle
//!   cannot be handed to another process. There the daemon still stops and
//!   starts, and `scrollback` is what softens it.
