//! A pane's screen survives the daemon being stopped and started.

//! The unit tests under `daemon::scrollback` cover the file: it round-trips, it
//! is trimmed from the front, the sweep keeps what it is told to keep. None of
//! that answers the question the feature exists for, which is whether a window
//! that comes back to a restarted daemon is shown what its panes had on them.
//! That answer involves a real daemon writing a real snapshot, dying, and a
//! second daemon handing the bytes to the client that asks — so this runs all
//! of it and reads the wire.
//!
//! The ordering is the whole difficulty. A client cannot ask for a restore
//! until the daemon is listening, so anything the daemon throws away *while
//! starting up* is thrown away before the only party who knows what is still
//! wanted has been able to say so.
