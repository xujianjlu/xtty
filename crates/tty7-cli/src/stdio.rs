//! Stdout for a command that lives inside pipelines.
//!
//! A reader that hangs up early — `| head -1`, `| grep -q`, PowerShell's
//! `Select-Object -First` — is how a pipeline ends, not a failure. Rust makes
//! that awkward twice over: it ignores SIGPIPE at startup so the doomed write
//! comes back as an `io::Error` instead, and `println!` turns that error into a
//! panic. `tty7 capture %1 | head -1` therefore printed a panic and a backtrace
//! note where `cat` would have exited without a word — noise on stderr for a
//! correct invocation, from a CLI whose whole point is being driven by scripts
//! and agents.
//!
//! Two mechanisms, one contract:
//!
//! - On Unix [`end_pipelines_quietly`] hands the job back to the kernel. That
//!   covers every write site at once, including ones added later, and gives
//!   callers the ending they already know from `cat` (shells report 141).
//! - Windows has no SIGPIPE — the write fails with `ERROR_NO_DATA` instead — so
//!   [`out`] is the stand-in that recognizes the hang-up and leaves quietly.
//!
//! Which is why every stdout write in this binary goes through [`out`] or
//! [`line`]: the `print!` family has no way to express "the reader left".
