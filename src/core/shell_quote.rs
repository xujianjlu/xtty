//! One set of rules for putting a real path onto a command line, shared by
//! everything that inserts one.
//!
//! Three places need this: the file tree's `cd` and paste, the terminal's
//! drop / clipboard / staged-image insertion, and completion accepting a
//! candidate. They used to carry three separate implementations, and on
//! Windows two of them disagreed — `file_tree::shell_quote_for` wrapped the
//! path in quotes and worked, while `view::shell_escape_path` escaped with
//! backslashes and ate the path separators of `C:\Users\me` (#593 fixed the
//! first one and never reached the other two).
//!
//! Three shells, three rules:
//!
//! - cmd.exe treats only double quotes as quoting. A single quote is an
//!   ordinary character there, so the POSIX form splits the path at its first
//!   space. Windows paths cannot contain `"`, so there is nothing to escape
//!   inside the quotes.
//! - PowerShell takes `'...'`, and writes an embedded `'` twice. The POSIX
//!   `'\''` seam is not a seam there — PowerShell does not join a quoted
//!   string to the bare word beside it — so `C:\Users\O'Brien` came out as
//!   something PowerShell reads as three tokens.
//! - Every POSIX shell takes `'...'` too, and breaks out for an embedded `'`
//!   via `'\''`.
//!
//! Backslash escaping is not used to quote anywhere. Only POSIX shells
//! understand it, and on Windows it collides head-on with the path separator.
//!
//! A leading `~/` stays outside the quotes: quoting it would make it a literal
//! and lose the home expansion the user is asking for.
