//! The source control panel's data pipeline: one cache of what each repository
//! looks like, one way to change it, and one way to say "that is now stale".
//!
//! Deliberately separate from [`super::git_status`]. That cache answers a
//! cheap question — branch name and a `+N −M` for a tab badge — on every cwd
//! change and every command boundary, for every pane. This one answers the
//! expensive question (`status --porcelain=v2 -uall`, seconds on a large
//! repository) and only while something is actually looking. Folding the two
