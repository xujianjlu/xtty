/// and clears the flag: that is the `chars_with_shift` branch on macOS,
/// `need_to_convert_to_shifted_key` in the Windows mapper, and Linux's "we
/// only include the shift for upper-case letters by convention". So the chord
/// written `secondary-shift-]` arrives as `secondary-}` and the two never
/// meet — the binding installs and is unreachable, which is why Ctrl+Shift+]
/// stopped cycling panes off macOS and why hand-editing a config to that
/// spelling changed nothing (#750).
///
/// Folding the spec the same way on the lookup side closes the round trip.
/// The recorder already writes `secondary-}`, because that is what
/// `spec_from_keystroke` was handed; a default or a config written the other
/// way now installs the very same binding, so both spellings keep working and
/// nobody's config comes undone. `secondary-shift-}`, which people also reach
/// for, folds onto it too — the flag is simply redundant there.
///
/// The table is US-layout, and a chord it does not know is left alone rather
/// than guessed at. It cannot be layout-aware from here: `?` is Shift+ß on a
/// German keyboard and Shift+, on a French one, and the only mapper that knows
/// which is gpui's, reached through `KeyBinding::load` rather than the
/// `KeyBinding::new` that `make_binding` uses — and it exists on Windows only,
/// where `MacKeyboardMapper` does no shift folding at all. So off a US layout
/// the fold is a widening that may not land: `ctrl-shift-4` picks up `ctrl-$`,
/// which on AZERTY is a key of its own. Harmless, because the fold only ever
/// adds — the spec as written stays bound whatever the layout — but it is why
/// this is not the last word on #750.
///
/// The fold is *added* to a spec's bindings, never substituted for them,
/// because the convention is not universal. Windows leaves Shift intact on
/// the numpad's `/ * + -`: `need_to_convert_to_shifted_key` lists the OEM
/// keys and `VK_0..VK_9` but none of `VK_DIVIDE`/`VK_MULTIPLY`/`VK_ADD`/
/// `VK_SUBTRACT`, so `get_keystroke_key` falls through to `get_key_from_vkey`
/// and Ctrl+Shift+numpad-/ really does arrive as `ctrl-shift-/`. Substituting
/// `ctrl-?` for it would unbind a chord that works today — the same class of
/// bug this is fixing. macOS clears the flag there anyway (the numpad glyph
/// is the same shifted or not, so `chars_with_shift` takes the branch that
/// drops it) and Linux names those keys `divide`/`multiply`/`add`/`subtract`,
/// which are not one character and never reach this.
