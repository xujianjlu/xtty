//! Opening a text box on a value the user is about to replace.
//!
//! A box that comes up with something already in it — a rename, a find bar, a
//! prompt carrying a suggested name — only behaves if the caret treats that
//! text as a *value* rather than as text to write around.
//! `InputState::default_value` leaves the caret at offset 0, so the first
//! keystroke prepends ("beta" over "alpha" gives "betaalpha"); `set_value`
//! leaves it at the end, so it appends. Both are wrong for something you are
//! replacing, and every find bar and rename box on the platform answers the
//! same way: select it.

/// `InputState::select_all` is `pub(super)` in the UI crate, so this goes

/// focus handle rather than at whatever happens to be focused.
///
/// It has to wait for a frame: actions route along the dispatch tree of the
/// last frame *drawn*, and a box created this turn is not in it — and frame
/// callbacks run before that frame is drawn, not after, so one wait is not
/// always enough. Rather than guess, dispatch and then look at whether it
/// took. That is also why this cannot be unit-tested: the test harness never
/// paints.
///
/// One box is deliberately left off this: the file tree's inline rename. The
/// selection lands there like anywhere else — typing does replace the name —
/// but that input paints no selection band, where the SFTP form's does, so the
/// name would go in one keystroke with nothing on screen to warn of it. A
/// selection you cannot see is worse than a caret in the wrong place, so that
/// box keeps its caret at the end until the painting is understood.
