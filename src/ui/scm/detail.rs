//! One commit, in the panel's own body.
//!
//! Replacing the body rather than opening a third kind of container: the
//! panel already knows how to draw a list of changed files, and the only
//! things a commit adds above it are its message and who wrote it. The file
//! rows are the same rows, minus the buttons — nothing here should be able to
//! drift from what the working tree shows.
//!
//! The patch itself still goes to the full-screen overlay. 260px is not a
//! place to read a diff.
//!
//! This is also where the panel pays back what the graph gave up. A history
//! row has about 26 characters beside its lanes and this repository's subjects
//! run to a median of 64, so the graph shows shape and this shows text: the
//! whole subject, the body, every ref, the parents, how many lines moved, and
//! the files.
//!
//! What it is *not* is a container of its own. It is drawn flush with the
//! panel, on the panel's fill, in the panel's type scale — the same dense,
//! low-chrome language as every other body the right panel shows. A
//! second-level view announces itself by the way back at the top of it and by
//! being the only thing on screen; it does not need a raised card, a larger
//! ramp or filled tokens to say so, and an earlier round that gave it all
//! three read as a foreign design pasted into the app.
//!
//! A round after that tried a larger ramp on its own — 14/12/11.5 — and it was
//! turned down for reading too big in a 260px column and too loud beside the
//! graph. That verdict was reached against a panel where everything else was
//! 12/11/10.5, so what it actually measured was the *step*, not the size: this
//! view a size above its neighbours. The neighbours have since moved. The whole
//! right panel runs on `right_panel.rs`'s 14/13/12/11 and tracks `ui_font_size`
//! with it, and being at 12 is now the thing that makes a tab read as a foreign
//! design. So the sizes here are 14/12/11 — and the rule the old note was
//! defending is unchanged and still the point: **this view is never a step
//! above the rows in `panel.rs`.** It is on the ramp with them.

// The names come from `right_panel.rs` and the sizes are not this view's to
// choose. This file used to hold three of its own — `SUBJECT_SIZE`,
// `SECONDARY_SIZE`, `TOKEN_SIZE`, at 12/11/10.5 — which was the panel's ramp as
// it stood on the day this file was written and stopped being it a few hours
// later.
//
// `TEXT` is the loudest thing on screen: the subject, and the way back, which
// is the same size worn quietly. `META` is everything that qualifies it — the
// byline, the message body, the parents' label, the file count, the waiting
// notes. One step of difference is all a qualifier needs in a column this
// narrow; the separation is carried by weight and colour, not by the gap.
// `META_MONO` is the token size — sha-like strings, ref chips, the diff counts
// — which is barely a choice made here: `git_badge` and `info_chip` are already
// set in it, and an object id has to read as the same kind of thing in this
// view as it does in the graph and on a file row. `TEXT_MONO` is a path, and
// only a path.
//
// Emphasis in this panel is weight and colour rather than size, and a fill only
// where it carries a meaning of its own — HEAD, and a tag. The subject is a
// step up in weight against the full foreground while everything under it is
// muted, and that separation is all it needs; it is what a card was briefly and
// wrongly asked to do. Nothing in this view is bigger than the working tree's
// rows are — which is now a statement about `panel.rs`'s rows rather than about
// a pair of numbers that happened to match.
