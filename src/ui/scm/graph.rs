//! The history section at the foot of the panel.
//!
//! Its job is shape first and text second. 260px leaves room for roughly 26
//! characters beside the lanes, and this repository's commit subjects run to a
//! median of 64 — so what a reader gets here is where the branches are, where
//! they merged, which refs sit where, and how recently anything moved. Reading
//! a whole message is the commit detail view's job, one click away.
//!
//! # What size everything is
//!
//! Three, and no more: 12px for the commit subject and for the
//! conventional-commit type in front of it, which are one run of text and are
//! told apart by tone rather than by size; 11px for the section's own heading
//! and for the "load more" control; and 10.5px for the annotations — the
//! relative age, the commit count, the ref chip. A sidebar list is dense by
//! design, and the graph is the densest thing in this panel.
//!
//! That is also VS Code's own reading of a sidebar graph, and it is why the
//! conventional-commit prefix is cut down to its type and demoted to muted ink
//! rather than left to eat half the line. The lane gutter itself never folds
//! away: the lanes are the graph, and a graph without them is just a list.
//!
//! The section is not a surface of its own. It sits flush on the panel's
//! `theme.sidebar` fill and is separated from the file list above it by a
//! hairline, the way every other band of this panel is. The only colour that
//! gets to be saturated here is a lane's, and the lanes stay in the gutter,
//! below the text; the rows themselves are ink, muted ink and the sidebar's own
//! neutral hover and selection fills.
//!
//! # How it is drawn
//!
//! One `canvas` covering the whole list, absolutely positioned over ordinary
//! interactive rows — never one canvas per row. Every `PrimitiveBatch::Paths`
//! gpui emits ends the current encoder, opens a render pass, clears a
//! drawable-sized intermediate texture, rasterises, resolves MSAA and
//! composites back; forty visible rows would mean forty of those per frame.
//!
//! Being on top costs nothing in event terms: `Canvas::id` returns `None` and
//! it implements no interactivity, so it registers no hitbox in prepaint. The
//! rows underneath keep gpui's native hover, click, context menu and
//! scroll-into-view. This was measured, not assumed — see the G7·0 spike commit.
