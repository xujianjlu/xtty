//! Dragging one split pane somewhere else in the same tab.
//!
//! The drag itself is gpui's — a pane's handle starts one and the pointer
//! carries it. What lives here is the part gpui cannot answer: where in the
//! layout the pointer is asking the pane to go, and whether that is a place
//! the tree can actually put it.
//!
//! Every landing is read against the pane under the pointer, from the middle
//! outwards:
//!
//! * **a pane's middle** — trade places with it, sizes included.
//! * **a pane's side** — the ring around that middle. Facing a neighbour in the
//!   same row or column, it means "go in beside them", and the newcomer takes
//!   an equal share of that row; facing across it, there is no row to join and
//!   it means "split this pane and take that side of it".
//! * **the far part of a side that is also the tab's own edge** — meaning
//!   "beside everything else", which is how a pane in the middle of a grid
//!   becomes a full-height column. Nothing else can express that: a drop read
//!   against a single pane can only ever split *that* pane. The band is sized
//!   to an even share of the columns (or rows) that side already has, so a
//!   third column is a third of the tab and not half of it.
//!
//! The last one is a share of the pane it is measured in, not a fixed strip
//! along the window. A strip wide enough to aim at on a 1400px tab is most of
//! a narrow pane, and one narrow enough to leave a narrow pane alone can only
//! be hit by accident on a wide one.
//!
//! The zone a pointer resolves to is only offered once the tree agrees it
//! changes something, so the highlight the user sees is never a promise the
//! drop will not keep.
