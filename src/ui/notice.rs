//! The pill the app floats over the terminal when something about the
//! connection needs saying.
//!
//! There were two of these — `render_remote_input_notice` in `app.rs` and
//! `render_ssh_status_strip` in `forwards.rs` — written out a builder call at
//! a time in two files, identical down to the padding and differing only in
//! the border colour. Each also placed itself: both were
//! `absolute().left_0().right_0().bottom_4()`, centred, and both were children
//! of the same container in `body_area`, with nothing arbitrating between
//! them. A remote workspace whose ssh link had also dropped drew them on top
//! of each other.
//!
//! So the shell lives here and the notices no longer place themselves. The
//! anchor is a column: a second notice stacks above the first instead of
//! landing on it.
