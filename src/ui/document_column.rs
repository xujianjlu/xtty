//! The slot the code panel and the diff overlay are drawn in.
//!
//! Both surfaces used to be full-workspace overlays — `absolute`, `inset_0`,
//! `occlude` — so opening a file to read it hid the agent that told you to read
//! it, and reviewing one turned into a toggle loop. They now dock as a column
//! beside the terminal instead, on the same pattern the right panel has always
//! used: a flex sibling with a drag handle and a persisted share of the width.
//!
//! A sibling column, rather than a narrower overlay, is the whole point: the
//! terminal element's laid-out bounds are what drive `set_grid_size`, so a
//! column takes width *away* from the grid and the PTY reflows to what is left.
//! An overlay painted over half the workspace would leave the grid full width
//! with half of it under a card.
//!
//! The overlay is not gone — [`DocumentLayout::Fill`] is exactly the old paint,
//! one command away, and a window too narrow to seat both a terminal and a
//! document falls back to it for that frame without touching what the user
//! saved.
