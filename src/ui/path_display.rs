//! The one place a path is shortened to start from `~`.
//!
//! Three rows shorten a path for display — the Info panel's cwd, the tab
//! strip's title, the home picker's recent list — and all three used to spell
//! the check their own way: read `HOME`, compare byte prefixes. On Windows
//! that missed twice over. `HOME` is often unset there (the variable is
//! `USERPROFILE`), and even a set home never matched a pane cwd that spells
//! itself with the other separator or different case — a PowerShell pane
//! reports `C:/Users/x/…` while `USERPROFILE` is `C:\Users\x` (#544).
//!
//! The comparison below normalizes both sides to `/` and folds case before
//! comparing, so every spelling of the same directory shortens. What comes
//! back is for reading only — a `~`-rooted path is spelled the way `~` paths
//! are spelled everywhere, with `/`. Nothing feeds it back to an API: the
//! Info panel's Copy Path and Reveal both carry the untouched `PathBuf`, and
//! the tab strip and picker only ever draw it.
//!
//! *Which* home a path is measured against is the caller's to say, because
//! only the caller knows which machine the path is on. A pane, a workspace
//! row or a tab title can name a directory on another host, and this
//! machine's `$HOME` answers for nothing over there: `/home/deploy/app` on a
//! server shortened to `~/app` on a laptop that happens to log in as
//! `deploy`, and stayed long on one that does not, so the `~` meant the
//! wrong machine either way (#580). [`home_for_host`] is where that question
//! is answered — the same borrow #568 took out of the file-link resolver.
