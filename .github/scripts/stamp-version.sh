# every versioned artifact — the binary's CARGO_PKG_VERSION, asset names, the DMG
# plist — reads Cargo.toml, so this one edit covers them all.
# Cargo.lock is left alone: cargo refreshes the root package's own lock entry
# automatically, without network access.
#
# Extracted from the inline step so nightly's several build jobs stamp
# identically, and so the guard below has exactly one home.

# virtual workspace whose members carry `version.workspace = true`, in which case
# the version to stamp moves to `[workspace.package]`. A nightly that quietly
# publishes assets named after the *last stable* version is far worse than one
# that fails here.
