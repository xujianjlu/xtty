# The macOS counterpart of assert-static.sh, and the same decision (D10) behind
# it: one `tty7-server` binary is pushed to an arbitrary remote Mac and has to
# run there with nothing installed alongside it. Static linking is not the
# instrument on macOS — Apple does not ship a static libSystem and linking one
# is unsupported — so the equivalent guarantee is "links only what the OS
# guarantees is present". A stray Homebrew dependency picked up from the runner
# would still compile, still pass a build-only job, and then fail on the first
# Mac that does not have /opt/homebrew — far from the change that caused it.

# arm64 refuses to execute an unsigned binary outright, so an unsigned build
# would not fail here but on the user's Mac, as "killed: 9" with no explanation.
#
# Asserted for both slices, not just arm64. The linker ad-hoc signs arm64 on its
# own and leaves x86_64 bare — which would be fine on an Intel Mac, but the
# x86_64 server is also what an Apple Silicon box gets when it asks through a
# Rosetta shell (`uname -sm` = "Darwin x86_64"), and that is not a machine to
# hand an unsigned binary to on a guess. The workflow signs it; this catches the
# day it stops.
# The verdict is `codesign -dv`'s exit status, not a word in its output. It
# spells the signature line differently per posture — `Signature=adhoc` for an
# ad-hoc or linker signature, `Signature size=8968` for a Developer ID one with
# a timestamp — so the `*"Signature="*` this used to match held only for ad-hoc.
# While the script pointed at the standalone tty7-server, which is ad-hoc
# signed, that was invisible; #692 pointed it at the bundle's binaries as well,
# and those are Developer ID signed whenever the signing secrets are present.
# Pull requests do not see the secrets, so every PR run took the ad-hoc branch
# and passed, and the first build that signed for real — the nightly — failed
# on all three binaries with `Signature size=` in the very output it printed as
# proof they were unsigned.
#
# Exit status has no such split: 0 for anything signed, 1 with `code object is
# not signed at all` for anything not. The output is still captured so the
# failure message can carry it.
