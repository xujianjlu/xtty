# The GUI must not touch the filesystem or git directly.
#
# Once a workspace can live on a remote machine, a path held by `ui::` or
# `terminal::` is not necessarily a path on *this* box, and `std::path`'s
# fs-backed APIs quietly answer for the wrong machine:
# `canonicalize` walks the local filesystem, `read_dir` lists the client's disk.
# Everything that may be looking at a workspace path — including one that lives
# on a remote Linux or macOS host — has to go through `ui::host_ops` / the `Host`
# trait, which routes to the local disk or the far side as appropriate.
#
# This script enforces that. It is deliberately *not* the raw grep from the
# contract: run bare, that grep reports 42 hits on a clean tree — not one of them
# git, all of them modules whose paths are local by construction — and a guard
# that always fails is a guard everyone learns to ignore. Two things fix it:
#
#   1. Test bodies are cut off properly. The contract's `grep -v '#\[cfg(test)\]'`
#      only removes the attribute line itself, leaving the whole test module
#      behind it in scope; here the scan stops at the `#[cfg(test)] mod …` that
#      opens the trailing test region.
#   2. An explicit allowlist, keyed on (file, pattern) rather than whole files, so
#      a module exempted for its `.is_absolute()` still trips on a new
#      `std::fs::`. Every entry carries the reason its paths cannot be remote.
#
# Adding an entry is a deliberate act: if the path could ever be a workspace
# path, the answer is `Host`, not an allowlist line.
#
# Usage: bash .github/scripts/check-host-boundary.sh
# Exit 0 = clean, 1 = violations (printed to stderr).

The GUI reached the filesystem/git directly.

A path in `ui::` or `terminal::` may belong to a remote workspace, where these
calls answer for the wrong machine. Route it through `ui::host_ops` / `Host`
instead (`Host::read_dir`, `join`, `is_absolute`, `canonicalize`, …).

If the path genuinely cannot be remote — app config, bundled assets, the local
temp dir — add it to the allowlist in this script with the reason why.
