## [26.9.2] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **A path is read out of the prose glued around it.** File detection used to
  take the whitespace-delimited token under the cursor, peel a bracket off each
  end and hope, which everything a build tool writes onto a path defeated:
  `--file=src/main.rs`, `note:src/x.rs`, a diff's `a/`, `ls -F`'s `src@`, a tree
  glyph with no space behind it. It is now a short ordered ladder of readings —
  left cuts name the prefixes that actually occur and stack against each other,
  right cuts trim sentence punctuation balanced-aware so `report(1).pdf`
  survives, and at most eight readings are tried per token. Location parsing
  grows `app.ts(10,2)` and `main.rs#L10` beside `:10:2`, and a path carrying no
  line number of its own takes one from beside it, so `File "handlers.py", line
  214` lands on the line rather than the top of the file. Hovering no longer
  needs the modifier: a resolved link underlines at 45% as soon as the pointer
  reaches it and only turns solid with a hand cursor once the modifier is down.
  Right-clicking a path opens a menu about that path — open, show in the file
  manager, copy path — and a file the built-in editor cannot read is handed to
  the desktop instead of refused.

- **A tab can be put in a sidebar group by hand.** Groups were derived and
  nothing else: the sidebar read a tab's cwd and filed it under the repo it
  found, so tabs that belong together for a reason the cwd cannot see — a few
  ssh sessions, three forks of one project, the two panes an investigation is
  spread across — had no way to sit together. A tab now moves into a named group
  from its context menu, and a stated group is never recomputed, so the probe no
  longer drags a hand-placed tab home on the next frame. Dragging a tab onto a
  custom group moves it there as well; a lifted tab fades every block that
  cannot take it, since a repo group's membership is decided by its tabs' cwds
  and "put this tab in tty7" is not a request the sidebar can honour honestly.
  Custom headers carry an asterisk, renaming rewrites every tab in the group in
  one pass, and "Group Automatically" gives a tab back to the probe.

- **Sidebar groups fold** (#804). A group folds shut when its header is clicked
  and stays shut across launches. A live search outranks the fold — a row a
  query matches shows whatever its group says. Folded rows register no
  rectangle, so a pane cannot be dropped into a group that is shut, and the
  header still counts every row the group has.

- **A remote pane's listening ports are detected and forwarded** (#787 for
  Windows). A remote workspace's ports were never listed: the pane lives in the
  peer's registry and the query went to this machine's daemon, which has never
  heard of it, so the answer was an empty list — indistinguishable on screen
  from a pane serving nothing. The peer answers now, gated on a feature so an
  older server says "I cannot tell you" rather than "nothing is listening". With
  the ports visible the forward stops being something to think about: a port
  opens on a click and a new one is forwarded unasked, at the same number where
  that number is free here. Ports and Forwards were two sections that never
  mentioned each other; a row is now a port, and the forward is where that row
  says it comes out.

- **tty7 can be the system's default terminal on macOS** (by @ayamir in #818).
  LaunchServices hands `ssh:`, `x-man-page:` and script opens to tty7. The URL's
  authority is read off the parsed URL rather than through Quick Connect's
  `user@host:port` reader, so a port, a path and percent escapes all survive;
  `x-man-page://3/printf` carries its section; and an external open that arrives
  while a window is still pulling its layout is parked rather than inserted,
  which is what used to turn a single tab into the whole workspace.

- **A bindable Close Window action** (by @bytehello in #778, reported by
  @rrpolanco in #773). 26.9.0's tray-retire model made closing the last window
  the "keep the daemon, drop the UI process weight" gesture, but that path was
  reachable only from the OS red close button. `CloseWindow` is that action, with
  no default key. The decision behind a window close — detach the workspace, and
  on the last window retire to the tray if an icon is actually up, otherwise quit
  — moves out of the close handler so the button and the action share it. In the
  palette it sits beside Quit, because that pair is the point: both end the
  window in front of you and only one takes your shells with it.

- **Opening a new window is a bindable action** (#793, from @jerryokk's #710).
  Registered globally as well as on the render root, since with the tray icon on
  — the default — closing the last window retires to the tray and leaves no
  window to dispatch it.

- **The pointer can take a range of diff lines and copy it** (#794, requested by
  @LittleSource in #721). The selection is keyed on the row's file and id rather
  than a flat list index, so collapsing a file above the selection does not
  re-point it.

- **A titleless tab is named after its working directory** (#792, requested by
  @rrpolanco in #740).

- **The tab whose pane is zoomed says so** (#782, reported by @rrpolanco in
  #752).

- **The host behind a connected tab can be edited from it** (#801, from
  @junyi-deep's #438).

- **TraeCode CLI support** (by @ayamir in #807).

### Changed

- **The sidebar has a text hierarchy, and colour is on state.** Every line sat
  at the same 4.5:1 grey — tab title, branch line, group header, search
  placeholder — so the only things that stood out were twelve identical agent
  discs and twelve copies of the same `+94 −26`, neither of which says which tab
  matters. Titles rise to a 7:1 floor with a cap that keeps the selected label
  its step above the rest; captions stay resting. The rail gets its own
  selection ladder, leaving the window's signed-off rung untouched. Diff counts
  render in a resting ink — same hue, blended toward the caption, walked back to
  the 4.5 floor where needed. A group whose rows all share one branch and diff
  says so once on its header, and rows with no status yet do not vote, so ⌘T no
  longer flips the group twice while the poll comes back. The workspace switcher
  card takes the same treatment: badges become words in the caption ink, only
  "taken over" keeps its warning colour, and the keyboard cursor takes the rung
  the ladder set aside for it instead of sitting one step under a hovered row.

- **The window's buttons show only under the pointer.** The new-tab, sidebar,
  right-panel and app-menu tiles were on screen at all times, so a window
  resting at the edge of the eye carried four buttons nobody was reaching for.
  Each group now paints only while the pointer is over the bar it belongs to.
  The window mark beside them stays put — it identifies the window rather than
  doing anything. The tiles keep their place in the layout and only lose their
  paint, so revealing a group never shifts what is beside it. With the detail
  panel open the strip's two tiles stay drawn, because they then stand over the
  panel's own header, whose tab tiles are painted whenever the panel is.

- **The inline controls are flat, and a tooltip's chord looks like a chord**
  (#803). Every field and button carried a faint lift that nothing else here
  has; this chrome separates surfaces with low-contrast fills and hairlines, so
  a control sitting a millimetre above the panel was the one place claiming
  depth. Panels that really do float keep their shadow. A chrome tile's shortcut
  now goes in the tooltip's own key-binding slot — set apart on the right, a
  size down, in the caption ink — instead of being pasted into the label to read
  as one odd sentence. Settings gets one field width at 260px rather than three
  picked where they were written, and the Program row's shell picker stops
  drawing a fill that met the field's border top and bottom and looked like a
  patch stuck over its right end.

- **The right panel's title row keeps its tiles and underlines the current
  tab.** The row hid its two trailing tiles until the pointer entered it while
  the three tab tiles beside them were always drawn — a row that grew two
  buttons on hover. The current tab is said with a bar under the glyph rather
  than a fill, because the fill was the same grey the hover state paints, so the
  lit tab and the tile under the pointer read as the same thing.

- **A pane's frame is never queued behind the grid lock.** One UI thread paints
  every pane in every window, and the thread holding the grid lock is the pane's
  own reader part-way through feeding a batch of output into the emulator, so
  waiting for it wired one pane's write speed to the frame rate of the whole
  window. A frame that cannot have the lock paints the one before it instead —
  unfair rather than queued on purpose, since a painter that queued would make
  the reader wait for a frame it is not going to get anyway. Each pane therefore
  owns its own cell buffer rather than sharing one scratch buffer, and the
  keyboard context and selection flag read frame-cached copies rather than
  locking once per caller.

- **The diff overlay draws its patch as a virtualised row list** (#799). The
  overlay built its whole patch as a nested element tree on every frame — a card
  per file, a header per hunk, six elements per line — so a few hundred lines of
  diff rebuilt tens of thousands of elements tens of times a second and the
  window stalled. It is one row per line now, built only for the rows on screen,
  and a change to one file splices just the rows it touched rather than resetting
  the list and losing the scroll position. The rows below the fold are counted at
  the 19px both views already give a line of a patch, so the scrollbar stops
  reading an 800-line patch as one viewport. The cards cannot survive that
  flattening, so the rows take the source control panel's own measurements
  instead of gpui-component's default container language.

- **A frame's header and payload go on the wire in one write** (#797, from
  @ivydt08's #713).

- **A directional pane move remembers where it came from per pane, not per
  direction** (#781, reported by @rrpolanco in #738). The per-direction array
  meant a two-step walk clobbered the first step, so Left, Left, Right, Right
  ended in the wrong pane.

### Removed

- **The Info panel's CONVERSATION outline is gone** (#703, #759). The list of an
  agent's turns, and the click that scrolled a pane back to where one started,
  are both taken out, along with the anchors the client kept for them. The OSC
  777 events the hooks send still drive the tab's status dot; nothing else read
  the rows the outline was built on. Output batches now split for one reason, so
  a replayed snapshot parses in a single pass again.

### Fixed

- **A line the shell is still holding is submitted as itself** (#800, from
  @junyi-deep's #433). The held seed is adopted at the editor's own doors rather
  than at submit time, so a recalled history entry, a ctrl-U, a ghost suggestion
  or a completion is no longer glued to the front of the gap text. It also
  closes a paste-provenance hole: releasing a hold pushed its contents into the
  typeahead record as plain text, dropping the paste mark, so a paste made
  during a gap that outlived the hold window came back looking typed and was
  submitted raw through the shell's binding table.

- **A plain single line is submitted as typed, not as a paste** (#790, reported
  by @failable in #660).

- **A pane notices it came home from ssh without waiting for output.** The probe
  that clears a pane's remote context only runs when the reader has bytes in
  hand, and the prompt a shell draws after a command is the last output a pane
  produces until the user types again — so an `ssh` that exited inside the poll
  interval left the pane reporting itself as remote indefinitely. Most visibly ↑
  read the remote history list, which for a host with no history of its own is
  empty, so ↑ appeared dead until some unrelated output arrived. A prompt mark
  that survives the foreground suppression is the shell saying the command is
  over, so the probe runs right then. Switching history scopes also dropped the
  list it was leaving; each scope's list is parked now, capped at four.

- **macOS notifications stop polling Notification Center from the UI thread.**
  The crate behind them noticed a click by parking the sending thread and adding,
  per outstanding notification, a repeating half-second timer on the main run
  loop that made a synchronous XPC round trip. A banner nobody clicks stays in
  Notification Center, so its timer never went away: sampled with nine
  outstanding, a fifth of the UI thread was inside that XPC and every window
  juddered. The click now arrives through a delegate of our own and nothing runs
  on the main thread until the user clicks. The identifier carries the pid too,
  so a banner left over from a previous run reveals nothing.

- **A ligated run stands over its own cells** (#785, reported by @rrpolanco in
  #751), and every ligature feature is named off rather than just `calt` (#788).

- **A solo glyph stays inside its cell when the next one is taken** (#783).

- **A shift-punctuation chord folds into the key the platform reports** (#784,
  reported by @rrpolanco in #750). Only half fixed: the US glyph table means
  secondary-shift-`]`/`[` stay unpressable on German, French and Nordic layouts.
  The control-code guard runs over the folded spelling too, so ctrl-shift-2 no
  longer installs ctrl-@ beside it.

- **A machine whose profile is gone is named, not spelled as a UUID** (#786,
  reported by @shihuaidexianyu in #485).

- **A repository is keyed by one spelling of its root** (#796).

- **A pane's paths are read in its own host's spelling** (#795).

- **The pointer can finish a Ctrl+Tab gesture the keyboard started.** Letting go
  of Ctrl over the workspace list slammed the panel shut and picked a tab, so
  switching workspaces by hand — the thing the pointer was on its way to do —
  was unreachable. A release with the pointer on the card but off the tab column
  now drops the hold and leaves the panel up; over the tab column it still
  commits. Two macOS consequences of holding Ctrl go with it: the search box no
  longer answers a mid-gesture click with Cut/Copy/Paste, and a tab row picked
  with the mouse arrives on the right button.

- **A dismissing click is spent on the dismissal.** The switcher's scrim covers
  the whole window, the tile that opens it included, and its mouse-down closed
  the switcher and then carried on down to whatever sat beneath — for that tile,
  straight back into the toggle that reopened it, so clicking it a second time
  looked like it did nothing.

- **The workspace tile answers a hover.** Its only hover state was a fill the
  palette derives one step off the surface, which on the rail is barely a change
  at all, and the name, the monogram and the chevron each pinned their own ink,
  so the button's hover never reached them. The text steps up to full strength
  now, the way a group header's does.

- **An untouched rename box no longer names the tab** (by @hhdebb in #849,
  reported in #848). The box opens holding the tab's label as rendered, so it is
  never empty, and it commits on blur as readily as on Enter — so opening it and
  clicking away stored that label as the tab's name, which stops following the
  pane. The box is read against what it was seeded with; an emptied box still
  clears the name, which is the only way to give a tab back to its pane.

- **An agent's status dot sits outside its disc** (by @hhdebb in #846, reported
  in #845). The dot places itself with negative offsets so it overhangs the
  avatar's edge, but it was a child of the element carrying the radius, so
  everything past the circle was clipped along the arc and the badge came back
  as a crescent.

- **A long branch no longer eats a group's name.** A header handed its overflow
  to the name and the branch by flex shrink, which splits it in proportion to
  what each asked for — so the longer string took the smaller cut and a heading
  came out as `DEL…` beside thirty characters of branch. The branch takes what
  it wants up to half the line, the name keeps the rest above a floor, and each
  is elided into its own share. A group of one row lifts its branch onto the
  header too (#836), and outside a repo a row's working directory rides on the
  title's line rather than growing a second one (#851).

- **A folded sidebar group hides its active row too** (#806). A fold left the
  active tab's row on screen, so folding the group you are working in drew a
  shut chevron with one row hanging under it and a header counting rows that
  were not there.

- **A custom group stays out of the workspace subject path.** The window titles
  itself after the last component of the group most of its tabs are in, and a
  custom group is a name rather than a path, so a hand-grouped workspace would
  have been titled `custom:work` and one grouped as `work/urgent` chopped to
  `urgent`.

- **The agent disc is painted solid again.** The resting tint from the hierarchy
  work read as a disabled tab rather than a quieter one: a column of 16% discs
  looked like a list of agents that had been switched off, and the brand hue is
  how the eye tells a Claude row from a Codex row before it reads either title.

- **An agent's mark has one colour, not one per draw site.** The tab strip and
  the tray icon each decided it on their own, so TraeCode came out green on a
  tab and white in the tray. The colour lives on the agent now and both sites
  read it.

- **The floating notices stack, and the forms have their keyboard back.** The
  remote input notice and the ssh status strip both placed themselves at the
  same spot, so a remote workspace whose ssh link had also dropped drew them on
  top of each other; the anchor is a column now. The managed port-forward form
  had no keyboard contract at all — no Return, no Escape, and it opened cold.
  The four sftp edit forms took the focus into a box they owned and dropped the
  box without handing it back, so naming a folder and pressing Escape left the
  caret on an element that had stopped rendering. And `Override` on the
  changed-host-key sheet — the one control that can accept a key that no longer
  matches — carried no colour at all; it greys until "yes" is typed and then
  goes red.

- **The right panel's tab underline reaches the rule that closes the row** on
  Windows and Linux, where the wrapper around the tiles is only as tall as a
  glyph, so the bar floated a few pixels above the line.

- **A seat that is coming back is waited for during a reap.** A seat is not free
  the same instant its holder is confirmed dead: the kernel releases the lock
  while tearing the process down, and a descriptor a `fork` left behind holds it
  a moment longer. One `EWOULDBLOCK` used to end the attempt and nothing ever
  revisited the file, so a dead pid stayed in it for good.

- **The Ports panel names the right machine.** Its fallback said "This machine's
  tty7-server is too old", which reads as the local one; the server that cannot
  answer is the far side's.

- **Turning off mouse reporting says what it costs** (#780).

- **The lockfile edges #799's merge walked back are restored** (#802). The merge
  re-resolved `Cargo.lock` and pointed twenty consumers at older copies of
  dependencies already in the tree. No `version =` line moved, so the change was
  invisible to the usual scan of a lockfile diff.

## [26.9.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **A remote server that will not start now says why** (#774). A remote
  workspace could sit in a loop nobody could get out of: every reconnect failed
  with "started but nothing was answering on the control socket after 15s", the
  strip showed a copy bar frozen at 100%, and no button was offered. A daemon
  whose control listener would not open logged one line and kept running — and a
  running daemon holds the single-server lock, so every later start stood down
  at once and every probe failed, forever. Whether something else is serving is
  now settled by connecting rather than by reading the errno, and a daemon that
  cannot listen exits. The reason is kept too: the remote daemon's output and
  exit status land beside the binary, stamped with the launch's own nonce so a
  restart never reads the outgoing daemon's status as the incoming one's, and a
  start that has already failed no longer waits out the full timeout. On the
  window side, an automatic reconnect retires its install progress instead of
  drawing an install still in flight, and a long error no longer stretches the
  status card past the window and takes the retry button off screen with it.

- **A stale pane socket no longer stops every later daemon** (#779). A daemon
  that died without unlinking its Unix socket left a file `bind` refuses, so the
  client launched a daemon, it exited on the bind, and the client launched
  another — forever. The removal is now decided by the single-server seat rather
  than the pidfile: holding the seat means nobody else can be serving that config
  dir, so anything still at the endpoint belongs to a process that is gone.
  Where there is no seat, a socket that answers is refused rather than removed.

### Changed

- **The control dialect is v9.** v8 added the project verbs; this build takes
  them back out and speaks v7's messages again, message for message — but the
  number does not go back with them. v8 is deployed, and a number that moves
  backwards stops being an identity: a 7 on the wire would mean either "before
  projects" or "after them" depending on which build put it there, and the
  handshake has nothing but the number to tell the two apart.

## [26.9.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Remote programs can copy images to the local clipboard over SSH.** A saved
  host can opt into OSC 5522 clipboard writes under **Advanced → Security →
  Remote clipboard images**. PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP transfers are decoded out
  of band, capped at 16 MiB, validated before they reach the system clipboard,
  and never enter scrollback or replay after reconnecting. The permission is
  off by default; clipboard reads and SVG writes remain unsupported.

- **Documents dock beside the terminal** (#625). Opening a file, toggling the
  code panel or opening a diff no longer covers the workspace: the document
  takes a column to the right of the terminal — half the space between the
  sidebar and the right panel by default — and the pane you were reading stays
  visible and typeable underneath none of it. Reviewing a file while an agent
  talks stopped being a toggle loop. Drag the divider for any width, double-click
  it to cycle a third, a half and two thirds, or use **Document: Third / Half /
  Two-Thirds Width** in the palette. Right-click the document's header for
  **Fill window** — the old overlay, unchanged, and per tab, so a file read
  over the whole window in one tab leaves the agent beside its own in the next.
  The terminal keeps its floor through all of it, and a window too narrow to
  seat both fills for that file only, without changing what any tab chose. New
  in `config.json`: `document_ratio`, and `document_layout` for what a fresh
  tab starts as.

- **A tab can be dropped into another tab, as a pane of it** (#621). Drag a tab
  by its chip or by its sidebar row, out over the panes, and it lands where the
  highlight says — the same reading as dragging a pane, minus the middle, which
  for a tab means "split this pane the way it is longest" rather than "trade
  places". A tab that was itself split arrives with its panes still arranged the
  way you left them and takes one share of the row or column it joined. Nothing
  restarts on the way over: a shell mid-command, an SSH session, an agent
  halfway through a turn all carry on, and only the tab they were in goes away.
  Picking a tab up no longer switches to it, so the tab you drop into is the one
  you were already looking at; a plain click still switches.

- **And back out again: a pane dragged onto the tab bar becomes a tab of its
  own** (#621). Take a pane by its grip up to the strip — or out to the sidebar,
  wherever the tabs are — and a caret says which two tabs it would go between.
  The last pane in a tab is offered nothing, being a tab of its own already.

- **Give the prompt back to the shell** — a new **Settings → Input → Prompt →
  Prompt editor** switch (`prompt_editor` in `config.json`, on by default).
  Turned off, tty7 stops editing the shell prompt: every keystroke there —
  printable keys, arrows, IME commits, paste, <kbd>⇥</kbd> and <kbd>⌃ R</kbd> —
  goes straight to the PTY, so zsh's ZLE, bash's readline and fish's reader own
  the line and the keys bound in a dotfile behave exactly as they do outside
  tty7, history traversal included. Previously the only way to get there was to
  hide the shell's own name from tty7 so integration never armed. Shell
  integration is untouched by the switch: prompt boundaries, working directory,
  exit codes, notifications and `tty7 procs` keep working. Tab completion and
  history search are menus tty7 opens inside that editor, so both grey out
  while it is off rather than sitting there doing nothing. It reaches open
  panes immediately, and a half-typed line is handed to the shell rather than
  dropped on the way over.

- **A host can be proved without spending a tab on it.** **Test** in the SSH
  host form dials the host exactly as Connect would — proxy, jump host, host
  key and authentication, all on the daemon — and reports back in place:
  `Connected and authenticated in 640 ms`, or what the handshake stopped to
  ask for (a password, a key passphrase, a keyboard-interactive answer, a host
  key nobody has accepted yet, or one that is not the key the server gave
  before), or the failure verbatim. A test never rides an existing connection
  — one would answer for the credentials *that* connection was made with, so a
  password typed wrong would come back green — and it never enters the
  connection cache, so it leaves nothing open and holds nothing up. An edit to
  the form drops the answer, which was about the host as it was typed a moment
  ago (#438).
- **The host form is reachable from wherever the machine is on screen.**
  Right-clicking a machine in the workspace switcher offers **Edit Host…** for
  a saved host, or **Save as SSH Host…** for one reached by address or by a
  `~/.ssh/config` alias; the switcher's **Add SSH Host…** now opens the form
  instead of the settings list you then had to find `+` on. A connection
  dialled by hand and worth keeping becomes a saved host from the palette —
  **SSH: Save Connection as Host…**, prefilled from the live session. The one
  thing that cannot come along is an ad-hoc `-J` hop, and that is said out
  loud rather than saved broken (#438).

- **A coding agent's conversation is an outline, and a way back into it.** The
  Info panel grows a **CONVERSATION** section: one row per turn, the prompt's
  first line as its label, a dot that says whether the turn is still running.
  Click a row and the pane scrolls so that turn's prompt is the top line — a
  long agent session in a terminal has never had a way back to "what did I ask
  an hour ago". It rides on the OSC 777 the hooks already send for the tab's
  status dot, so it costs a cut only when an agent event actually arrives, and
  it works wherever the agent runs — over ssh, in a container, in a remote
  workspace — rather than only where a transcript file happens to be readable.
  Reattaching to a pane rebuilds the outline from its own replayed history. A
  turn that began on the alt screen is listed but not clickable, because there
  is no scrollback behind it to return to. Agents whose hooks do not report
  prompt text (Codex, Copilot, Grok) are left out rather than drawn as a column
  of anonymous dots.


- **The interface font is configurable** (#761). **Settings → Appearance →
  Typography** now carries an interface font family beside the terminal one, so
  the chrome can be set apart from — or matched to — what the panes are using.

- **A coding agent's conversation gets an outline, and every turn is a jump
  target** (#703). The right panel lists the turns it saw go by; clicking one
  scrolls the pane back to where that turn started. A turn under a full-screen
  agent has nothing to land in, and the row now says so on hover rather than
  drawing a link that does nothing (#759).

- **A remote workspace relinks its own dead panes** (#757). Panes whose SSH
  route died come back on their own when the link returns, and the tabs are
  named after what is actually running in them instead of keeping whatever the
  snapshot said.

- **Saved SSH hosts are one click from the New Tab button** (#647), and an SSH
  pane names itself after its host, reaches the host form from wherever you
  are, and can test a connection before you commit to it (#566).

- **Nushell panes get OSC 7 cwd tracking and OSC 133 prompt marks** (#637), so
  the sidebar follows a Nushell pane's directory and command marks work the way
  they do under the other supported shells.

- **The shell's own line editor owns the prompt** (#633). tty7 stops
  second-guessing the line being edited and hands the row to zsh, fish, bash or
  Nushell, which is what makes their completion, history search and multi-line
  editing behave the way they do outside tty7.

- **A tab whose cwd is not a repository groups by its folder** (#631) instead of
  falling into an unsorted pile at the bottom of the sidebar.

- **The wheel-zoom modifier is configurable** (#676) — for anyone whose mouse or
  trackpad already spends Ctrl+wheel on something else.

- **`tty7 server restart` replaces the server in place, keeping every session**
  (#669). The old stop-and-start is still there behind `--hard` for when the
  process really does have to go.

- **Linux updates install in app** (#306, #652). A verified AppImage release is
  downloaded, checked and swapped in without leaving tty7, the way macOS and
  Windows already worked.

- **An all-users Windows install updates through a single UAC prompt** (#562)
  rather than one per file it has to replace.

- **A file path printed by a program opens in tty7**, resolved on the host the
  pane is actually on (#568) — a path from an SSH pane opens the remote file,
  not a local one that happens to share its name.

- **The workspace switcher is a flat list with a create form**, and connecting
  to a machine syncs its workspaces at that moment rather than whenever the
  next poll came round (#616).

- **SFTP opens remote text files in the built-in editor** instead of handing
  them to whatever the OS thought should have them.

- **Hooks, resume and fork are wired for the CLI agents that support them**
  (#666), and Kimi Code CLI is detected and driven like the rest (#694).

- **Four dark themes** (#663).

- **Closing the last window retires tty7 to the tray** rather than quitting it,
  so the shells keep running and the next launch is instant (#639).

- **A `tty7-server` build is published for macOS** (#605), so a Mac can host a
  remote workspace and not only connect to one.

- **↑ and Ctrl+P recall the last command that matches what is already typed**
  (#768), instead of walking history from the end regardless of the prefix.

### Changed

- **The Info panel's `agent` row is gone.** It said `Claude Code · working`
  beside a status dot — the same name and the same dot the tab and its sidebar
  row were already wearing, two panels away from neither of them. The
  CONVERSATION section below now says what that agent is doing in a form the
  row never could, and the dot stays where it was learned.
- **A zsh or fish you gave your own arguments to is no longer injected into.**
  Custom arguments have always been the line where tty7 backs off — the bash,
  PowerShell and WSL setups checked for them — but the zsh and fish setups did
  not, so a `fish` started with your flags had `-C <script>` appended to them
  and a `zsh` had its `ZDOTDIR` swapped out from under its startup files. Both
  now behave like the rest. **This turns shell integration off for a config
  that sets `shell` or a `custom_shells` entry with `args`** — including the
  `{"program": "fish", "args": ["-l"]}` the reference page used to print as an
  example — so prompt marks, working directory reporting, command-finished
  notifications, inline completion, <kbd>⌃ R</kbd> and per-pane history stop in
  those panes. Drop the arguments to get them back, and the notice a pane
  raises when integration never engaged now names this as a cause (#624, #629).
- **An SSH pane is named after its host.** A fresh SSH tab reads the host's
  name, or its address when the host has none — every host imported from
  `~/.ssh/config` arrives nameless, and a window full of them all read `tty7`
  until the far shell happened to title itself. The name survives a title
  reset and a dropped link (`prod-web — disconnected`), and a tab titled
  `deploy@10.0.0.5:2222` is shown whole rather than cut down to `2222`: the
  `user@host:` head is only a head when a path follows it (#438).
- **The host form's authentication row is a dropdown**, not a six-way
  segmented control — it was the row that stacked first on a narrow page. And
  the three proxy fields no longer read as independent: only the first one
  filled is used, so the losing fields now say `Not used: Proxy command comes
  first.` instead of leaving it to be discovered by connecting (#438).

- **A workspace reads its own name from the first frame, and stops changing
  under you.** Every workspace a window creates is given a generated name —
  `keen-marten` — and that is the name `tty7 ws ls` prints and `tty7 ws rename
  keen-marten …` addresses. The window that created it was never told: a client
  is left out of the deltas its own edits raise, and both create paths threw
  away the name the machine sent back, so the chip showed the directory its
  shells happened to start in. The GUI and the CLI gave two different answers to
  "what is this workspace called", and the real name arrived later — at the
  first daemon restart, rebuild or relaunch — looking like the workspace had
  renamed itself. A window now learns the name along with the layout, so the
  chip agrees with `ws ls` from the start. A workspace with no name, which is
  what `tty7 new` leaves behind, still reads the directory it is working in, and
  a name you chose yourself still wins (#604).
- **File links open in tty7 instead of leaving it.** A ⌘/Ctrl-clicked file path
  now opens in the built-in editor, on the line and column the link named, and
  the Files panel selects it and scrolls it into view; a directory link opens
  the panel on that directory. **Settings → Terminal → Links → Open files with**
  picks between the built-in editor, the OS file association and a command of
  your own — anyone who had already set `link_file_command` keeps it.
- **A pane address may now be written without its `%`** — `tty7 pane ls
  --json` prints bare ids, so `83` addresses the same pane as `%83`
  everywhere an address is taken. One behaviour goes with it: a lone `tty7
  send 83` used to type "83" into the caller's own pane and now reports that
  it has nothing to send, the same as a lone `send %83` always did. It fails
  loudly and never presses anything anywhere; to type a number as text, name
  the pane too (`tty7 send %5 83 --enter`) (#538).


- **The seam between panes is lighter than the outline around a menu** (#771).
  One hairline colour used to serve both, which made the sidebar, the right
  panel and the document column read as boxes bolted together rather than one
  surface. The two are derived the same way and floored differently now: a line
  that is the only thing marking an edge keeps its weight, a line running
  between two panes that already carry their own fills steps back.

- **The app's copy is shorter** (#663). Settings descriptions, prompts and
  notifications lost the sentences that were restating their own titles.

- **`tty7 send` takes the bare pane id that `--json` prints** (#699), so an id
  read out of one command can be pasted into the next without editing it.

- **The control dialect is v6** (#605). A daemon left behind by an older build
  is detected at launch and offered a restart instead of serving a window with
  no tabs.

### Fixed

- **A conversation row no longer offers a jump the pane cannot make.** Clicking
  one under a full-screen agent did nothing at all: no scroll, no message,
  nothing. The row had an anchor, so the panel drew it as a link — pointer,
  hover fill and all — while the view refused the jump, because a pane on the
  alternate screen has no scrollback to land in. Switching Claude Code into
  `/tui fullscreen` mid-session is enough to produce it: the turns recorded
  under the classic renderer keep their anchors, and every one of them goes
  quiet at once. The two conditions now live in one predicate both sides read,
  and a row that goes nowhere says why on hover rather than leaving grey text
  to carry a meaning grey does not have. Jumping is still off while an agent
  renders full-screen — there is genuinely nothing behind it — but the panel no
  longer pretends otherwise.

- **In-app updates work again on macOS** (#708). Every "Update and Relaunch"
  failed with `codesign did not report a designated requirement`, on every
  build and both channels, with nothing a user could do but download the app by
  hand. The updater compares the signing requirement of the staged app against
  the installed one, and read `codesign -d -r-`'s answer off stderr — where
  codesign puts only the `Executable=` header. The requirement is on stdout, so
  the check could never match. Both streams are read now, and the parse is
  split from the process call so a test can hold it against codesign itself
  rather than against our belief about it.

- **A tree pull that has to be retried no longer ends with the window deleting
  the tabs it was pulling.** A window told to rebuild itself from the machine —
  a daemon back as a new process, a restart handoff that was refused, a remote
  server restarted — abandoned that job the moment it had any tabs at all, and
  in every one of those cases it does: the stale ones on screen are the whole
  reason it was asked. So the rebuild silently did nothing, and worse, the
  window went on claiming to speak for the workspace it had never read. Opening
  one tab over it then diffed into "close every tab" and deleted those panes'
  records while their shells were still running, with nothing left that could
  reach them. The retry is now dropped only for a tab the user really did make
  while the pull was out, and a window waiting on a rebuild adds to its machine
  without pruning it until the pull lands (#579).
- **Installing an update on Windows shows a progress window.** The installer
  ran `/VERYSILENT`, so from the app quitting to the new build coming up —
  tens of seconds, longer under an antivirus scan — the screen held nothing
  at all, and "clicked update, the app vanished" read as a crash. The
  installer now runs `/SILENT`: still unattended, but Inno's own progress
  window stays on screen for the gap (#600).
- **Orphan panes are visible in the GUI, and closable from it.** A shell
  left running after its workspace went away — what an interrupted `tty7
  run` leaves behind — showed up nowhere in the GUI; only the CLI's `tty7
  pane ls --all` could see it, and only `pane close --orphans` could stop
  it. The workspace switcher's local machine group now lists those
  background panes with their owner and working directory, each with a
  Close button (#596).
- **A launch that restores one of several windows says what it left behind.**
  Quitting with several windows open and starting again restored only the
  most recent one; the rest were marked detached — panes alive, nothing on
  screen, the only trace a log line. The restored window now shows a
  notification naming how many workspaces are still running in the
  background and where to reopen them (#597).
- **`tty7 pane close %99` fails when no pane 99 exists.** The orphan path
  hangs the pane up directly, and that kill is fire-and-forget — the daemon
  never says whether it knew the pane — so a typo'd id printed
  `{"closed":[99]}` and exited 0, telling a reaper script the leak it was
  chasing was gone. Close now checks the id against the running-pane
  registry first and reports the miss under `failed` with exit 1 (#588).
- **cd Here and Insert Path quote for the shell the pane runs.** Both used
  to wrap a path with spaces in POSIX single quotes whatever the pane's
  shell was, and cmd.exe — where a single quote is an ordinary character —
  then split the path at its first space. The quote style now follows the
  pane's shell: double quotes for cmd.exe, single quotes for PowerShell and
  every POSIX shell (#593).
- **Remote path completion says what it's doing.** Tab-completing a path
  on a remote workspace used to show nothing for the whole network
  round-trip — a slow link read as a broken Tab key — and a listing that
  failed ended in exactly the silence an empty directory ends in. A pill
  over the pane's corner now says the listing is running, and a failed
  listing reports its error there instead of vanishing (#585).
- **Seven hard-coded English strings moved into the language tables.** The
  shell-integration notice, the pane titles a disconnected or exited pane
  wears, the loopback forward's failure, the tray tooltip that lists running
  agents, the cursor-shape choices, the command palette's empty-result hint
  and the updater's install hint all used to render in English whatever the
  UI language was; they now follow it, and the palette's hint no longer
  suggests connecting over SSH in menus that have nothing to do with hosts
  (#602).
- **A half-typed tab rename survives other tabs closing and the strip
  reordering.** The rename box tracked its tab by index, so any unrelated
  tab event forced it closed to keep the commit from landing on the wrong
  tab — and even then, a reorder mid-rename left a window where the name
  went to the tab that had taken the index over. The box now tracks its tab
  by tree id: only closing the renaming tab itself ends the rename, and the
  commit lands on the tab the box was opened on wherever it has moved
  (#598).
- **A zoomed pane stays zoomed when you leave its tab and come back.** Zoom
  was a window-level value that activating any tab cleared, so looking at
  another tab and returning restored the split layout — while a zoom is a
  tab's temporary view state, like its focused pane. It now rides with the
  tab; the clears that genuinely reshape the layout (drag, split, close)
  still stand, and a zoom whose pane exited while the tab was away does not
  come back (#599).
- **Opening and closing the search bar no longer erases the grid
  selection.** The selection that seeds the query is the thing being
  searched for, yet opening the bar ran the same unconditional clear as
  *changing* the query, and closing cleared it again — select text, press
  Ctrl+F then Esc, and the selection was gone. The seeded selection is now
  kept through the open, and closing keeps whatever selection the grid
  holds; only an actual query change retires it, the discipline the output
  rescan path already stated (#584).
- **Search highlights follow the text when the pane is resized.** A match
  point is an absolute (line, column) against the width it was scanned at,
  so narrowing a pane reflowed the text out from under every highlight until
  new output happened to trigger a rescan — and a quiet local pane has none
  coming. A column change now rescans immediately, with the output path's
  discipline (the selection and scroll position are left alone); a
  rows-only change reflows nothing and stays cheap (#586).
- **A mistyped "Start in" path is refused at save instead of silently
  rerouting every new pane.** The custom path used to be stored unchecked,
  and the daemon's picker then skipped it — not a directory — and started
  each new shell in its own fallback directory, so "new shells don't start
  in my project" read as a tty7 bug rather than a typo. Settings now marks a
  non-existent directory in red and does not save it, and a hand-edited
  `config.json` holding one gets a `log::warn!` naming the path at the
  moment the fallback engages (#601).
- **`tty7 doctor` exits 1 when the server is unreachable.** Doctor is the
  verb people run when something is not working, so an unreachable server is
  *the* finding — not a row to exit 0 over while `tty7 doctor || alert`
  never fires. The full table and JSON still go out, and stderr carries the
  headline under `-q` (#592).
- **The `owner` field of `pane ls --all` is documented the same way in both
  references** — the bundled skill reference still claimed the CLI stamps a
  literal `"tty7-cli"` owner, the behaviour that was removed because an owner
  names the workspace allowed to attach. Both now describe the workspace id,
  or its absence while a pane is unfiled (#591).
- **A failed `tty7 wait` now says so on stderr even under `-q`.** Timeout and
  "pane exited first" are structured exits, so they bypassed the anyhow path
  that prints under quiet mode and left the exit code as the only evidence —
  against the documented "errors still go to stderr". Both now print a
  one-line headline to stderr, the discipline `pane close` already set (#590).
- **A timed-out `tty7 wait` now answers in the same JSON shape as a finished
  one** — `matched`, `stale` and the agent session fields, plus
  `"timed_out": true` — instead of a bare object missing the fields a
  consumer's error branch was written against. The schema, including
  `timed_out`, is now documented (#589).
- **Cancelling the amend confirmation no longer switches amend off.** The
  toggle was cleared when Commit was pressed — before the "rewrite the last
  commit?" prompt — so answering Cancel returned to a panel whose amend mode
  had silently been dropped, and the next Commit created the brand-new commit
  the user had just declined to risk. The toggle now switches off only when
  the commit actually runs (#595).
- **The SCM panel's "discard all" confirmation no longer overstates what it
  does.** The prompt asked to "discard every change in this repository" while
  the operation has always left staged changes alone — it sweeps only unstaged
  edits and untracked files. The prompt now says exactly that, in all three
  languages (#594).
- **A local daemon that dies and comes back no longer leaves a window of dead
  panes looking live** — from the client's side a killed daemon is
  indistinguishable from one whose shells all exited at once, so the window
  kept showing every pane with its last title, and the reconnect then pushed
  that dead layout back up as the new daemon's truth. The control handshake's
  instance id is now compared on every local reconnect — the same check the
  remote path already made — and a changed instance rebuilds each local
  window from the machine tree instead: tabs come back, and each pane is
  restored from its scrollback snapshot with the "this is a new shell" banner
  rather than left frozen mid-lie. The restart-server action uses the same
  rebuild path (#553).
- **A file link in a remote pane no longer opens this machine's copy.** An
  absolute path was checked against the local filesystem whatever the pane was
  connected to, so `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` on a server opened the one on your
  laptop, silently. Paths are now resolved on the pane's own host, and a pane
  running `ssh` typed into a local shell — where neither side can answer for
  them — no longer offers file links at all. A file on another machine opens
  in the built-in editor whatever **Open files with** says, since a local
  `open` or editor command would land back on this machine's copy.
- **Relative paths resolve from where the work is, and from the repository
  around it.** Detection followed the shell's kernel cwd, which an agent
  working in a git worktree never updates, and only ever tried one directory —
  so a path a build tool printed from the workspace root did not resolve from a
  member directory. A path that matches nothing under either now says so
  instead of the click doing nothing.
- **A broken config.json can no longer be silently replaced by defaults** —
  a file that failed to parse was ignored with only a log line, and the next
  write of any setting — dragging the sidebar divider, zooming the font with
  Ctrl+=, saving anything in Settings — serialized the in-memory defaults
  over it wholesale, turning one typo into the loss of every hand edit. A
  load that fails to parse now keeps the file's contents beside it as
  `config.json.corrupt` (the same quarantine `views.json` already had), and
  the stand-in defaults carry a mark that makes `save` refuse to run, so
  nothing writes until the file parses again. The hot-reload watcher tells
  "broken" apart from "absent" and keeps the settings the app is running on
  instead of swapping defaults in mid-session, and both the startup and the
  reload path say what happened and where the copy is. A file that simply
  cannot be *read* logs a warning now too — it used to fall to defaults with
  no trace at all. (#537)
- **A mistyped `tty7 send` address no longer types itself into your own
  pane** — `tty7 send %3x --key C-c` used to degrade the unparseable `%3x`
  into text aimed at the pane the caller was sitting in, then deliver the
  Ctrl-C there too, interrupting whatever was in front of them. A `%`
  followed by a digit that still fails to parse is now the address error it
  looks like, while text that merely starts with `%` — vim's `%s/foo/bar/`,
  `%!sort` — keeps typing as given, as does anything unmarked that is not a
  plain number (#538).
- **The `ws rm` docs now say the panes are hung up, not orphaned** — the CLI
  reference claimed removing a workspace leaves its panes running as orphans
  to be found with `pane ls --all`, when the code has hung them up since the
  command exists; only a *failed* hang-up (which `ws rm` reports by pane id)
  leaves orphans behind. The site reference, the bundled skill reference, and
  `ws rm --help` all read the same way now (#539).
- **The Info panel's agent row reads one pane, not a splice of two** — the
  name came from `tab.agent` (whichever leaf has an agent) while the status
  came from `tab.agent_status` (the most urgent across the whole tab), so a
  split tab running two agents could show one pane's name beside the other
  pane's state. The row now takes both from the detail pane when it has an
  agent, and otherwise from the tab's most urgent agent pane — so the row
  still holds while focus sits on a plain shell, and its two halves always
  describe the same pane (#543).
- **Windows paths in the Info panel shorten to their leaf again** — the cwd
  row split on `/` only, so a backslash-spelled path (any agent-reported cwd,
  a cmd pane, the shell-integration-off case) elided its *tail* and hid the
  directory's own name. The split now takes the last of either separator,
  and the `~` shortening — shared by the Info panel, the tab strip, and the
  home picker — reads `USERPROFILE` as well as `HOME` and compares with
  separators normalized and case folded, so a `C:/Users/…` pane shortens
  under a `C:\Users\…` home (#544).
- **A hand-edited keybinding takes effect without a restart.** The config
  watcher reloaded everything except the keymap, so a `keybindings` edit
  showed up in the settings list off the live global while the key itself
  stayed dead until the app restarted. The watcher now rebuilds the keymap
  when the binding config actually changed — `(keybindings,
  keybinding_preset, prefix)` — so the app's own `save()`, which a sidebar
  drag or a palette open triggers, does not churn it. The rebuild also
  replaces the map instead of appending to it, so rebinding no longer leaves
  a retired copy of the whole table behind for every keystroke to walk. A
  config.json that does not parse keeps the keys it was already dispatching,
  since the reload that fails never reaches the rebuild (#548).
- **The font-size and line-height steppers no longer push a hand-set value
  the wrong way** — the settings steppers and the `Ctrl+=`/`Ctrl+-` keys
  clamped to a narrower range (font 6–48, line height 1.0–2.0) than the
  config file allows (4–256, 0.5–4.0), so `font_size: 50` shrank to 48 on
  "+" and wrote that back, permanently changing a value it only meant to
  nudge. The steppers and `sanitize` now share one range, defined next to the
  validation. The scrollback and notify-threshold preset rows got the matching
  fix: a value between two buckets no longer lights up the nearest one
  (`scrollback_limit: 5000` highlighted "10,000", and clicking that cell
  silently overwrote it) — it shows a "Custom (5,000)" cell that names the
  real value and is not a button (#550).
- **A refused in-place daemon restart no longer strands every pane it
  promised to keep** — Restart Server clears the window before attempting the
  handoff, and when the handoff failed the window simply stayed empty with an
  error on the home page. The daemon was still running and serving those
  panes, but every restore path is driven by the machine tree, and the next
  sync of the emptied window diffed into "close every tab" against it —
  deleting the pane records under shells that were still alive, or the whole
  workspace at once if the user just closed the window, right after the
  dialog had promised nothing would be interrupted. A failed restart now
  drops the dead link and pulls the layout back from the tree, reattaching
  the living panes; where the failure really did take the daemon away, the
  missed pull leaves a rehydration debt instead, which is what stops the
  empty window from being pushed up as the layout. (#554)
- **Settings' Shell Arguments field now splits like a command line, and quotes
  on the way back.** The field split on raw whitespace, so `-c "echo hi"`
  reached the new shell as four argv fragments with the quote characters still
  attached, and the damage was invisible until the pane misbehaved. The round
  trip was lossy in the other direction too: a perfectly legal
  `"args": ["-c", "echo hi"]` in `config.json` refilled the field as
  `-c echo hi` and re-committed as three argv the moment it lost focus, without
  the user typing a thing. Quoted text is now one argument, the refill quotes
  the arguments that need it, and a value whose quotes do not close is refused
  with an explanation under the input rather than saved as fragments. A path
  spelled with backslashes still means itself. (#551)
- **`tty7 send --enter` now presses Enter when there is nothing to type** —
  `--enter` is shorthand for `--key enter`, but it was never counted as a key,
  so `tty7 send %42 --enter` answered "needs TEXT … or a --key to press"
  instead of running what pane 42 already had typed. It counts now, with an
  address or without one (`tty7 send --enter` presses Enter in your own pane).
  An *unmarked* id is deliberately left out: `tty7 send 83 --enter` reads as
  much like typing "83" where you are sitting as like pressing Enter in pane
  83, so it stays a loud error that names both spellings (`send %83 --enter`,
  `send %PANE 83 --enter`) rather than quietly retargeting the keystroke
  (#581).
- **A `~` in a path now belongs to the machine that path is on.** The Info
  panel's cwd, the tab strip and sidebar titles, and the switcher's workspace
  and tab rows all shortened against *this* machine's `$HOME` whoever the path
  belonged to, so a server sitting in `/home/deploy/app` read as `~/app` on a
  laptop that happens to log in as `deploy` and stayed spelled out on one that
  does not — the `~` naming the wrong machine either way. Each of those rows
  now measures a path against the home its own host reported when the link
  came up, and a path on a machine nothing here has a link to — or one a pane's
  shell has `ssh`'d away to — is shown in full rather than against a home that
  is not its own. (#580)
- **Push at a detached HEAD no longer fails silently** — the sync tile claimed
  "Publish Branch" (the one thing a detached HEAD cannot do) and swallowed the
  click, and the key binding, palette and "Commit and Push" follow-up died in
  the same guard just as quietly. The tile and the branch menu's Push item now
  disable themselves with a tooltip that says why, every other path gets a
  toast naming the reason, and an unborn branch — no commits to send yet —
  gets its own answer instead of sharing the detached one's silence. (#545)
- **A refused commit says why, not always "Nothing to commit"** — committing
  from the palette or the key binding with staged work but a blank message was
  answered with "Nothing to commit", which sends the user staging files they
  already staged; the toast now carries the plan's actual reason ("Write a
  commit message first"), the same words the panel's own button shows on its
  tooltip. (#546)
- **Terminal pop-up menus no longer leak clicks into the grid behind them** —
  the completion menu and the reverse-search menu (both the floating panel and
  the input-bar row) inserted no hitbox of their own, so a press on one fell
  straight through to the terminal: it cleared whatever was selected and
  dragged out a new selection, merely moving over a row underlined the text
  beneath it, and a Ctrl+click opened the link the menu was covering. All
  three occlude now, so a press on a menu stops at the menu. (#541)
- **A file link that fails to open says so** — clicking a file path whose
  opener is missing, or whose `link_file_command` template expands to nothing,
  used to fail into a logfile line and nothing else; the click now raises the
  same kind of toast a failed image upload does, naming the path and the
  error. (#542)


- **A restart no longer asks a second time about a server that is already
  gone** (#770). The record behind the "Restart Server?" prompt could only ever
  accumulate: the control link re-armed it on every failed reconnect, including
  in the seconds spent reading the dialog, so restarting fixed the daemon and
  not the record and the next window asked again. A probe that finds the daemon
  ours now clears it, on both the handoff and the stop-and-spawn paths, and a
  verdict about a daemon that has since been replaced is dropped rather than
  written.

- **A split pane's cursor reflects which pane actually has focus** (#736) —
  both cursors could render active at once, so neither said where typing would
  land.

- **The agent unread badge reads live focus** (#758), instead of clearing on a
  pane that was merely visible.

- **Clicking a sidebar row's change counts activates that row before opening
  its diff** (#706, #729), so the diff that opens is the one whose numbers were
  clicked.

- **A window arriving at a workspace no longer claims to speak for panes it has
  not read** (#716, #728) — the state that let a fresh window prune tabs it
  knew nothing about.

- **Every SSH channel tty7 abandons is closed before the server does it**
  (#715, #727). Leaked channels accumulated over a long session until the
  server's per-connection limit refused the next pane.

- **A restored tab keeps its name** (#725). The title was left out of the
  snapshot, so a tab restored after a restart came back labelled by its shell.

- **An emoji that overflows its cell gets the room instead of being shaved
  flat** (#707), and a regional-indicator pair is shaped as the one flag it is
  rather than two letters (#686, #691).

- **An orphan pane's Close button stays on screen** (#712) — the one control
  that could clear it was the first thing to scroll away.

- **A stalled remote link no longer blocks the UI thread** (#709). A server
  that stopped answering froze the whole window rather than the one workspace

## [26.8.3] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **A full Source Control panel** — the half-finished Changes tab is now a
  working-tree panel with a real index. Files are grouped into merge, staged,
  changes and untracked, with a file appearing in two groups when its status
  says so; the rows stage, unstage, discard and open a diff, and a commit can
  be written, amended, pushed, pulled or synced from the panel itself. The file
  tree carries git decorations beside every entry, folded once per refresh
  rather than once per frame. A diff opens from three sources — working tree,
  staged, or a commit — behind a unified/side-by-side toggle that names which
  one it is showing. Under the file list sits a commit history drawn with
  lanes, paged as you scroll, with lane colours derived from the theme's own
  `ansi16` and walked to a contrast floor so they stay apart on every builtin.
  Anything that can lose work asks first, and the data layer is the single
  place that decides what counts as destructive. **The control protocol does
  not change** — an unmodified remote server serves all of it, push, pull and
  fetch included, because the deadline that would have cut a long network
  operation short was only ever enforced client-side. Non-UTF-8 paths are a
  documented read-only limitation: those rows carry a tooltip rather than
  sending git a pathspec nobody can spell. (#424)

- **The interface has a font size of its own** — `ui_font_size` in
  `config.json` scales the whole chrome, and every window's root sets it, so
  sidebar, panels, menus and dialogs move together. It defaults to gpui's own
  16, so an existing config renders exactly as before. The terminal grid is
  unaffected: it stays absolute pixels off `font_size`, which means a display
  that is not Retina can finally have readable chrome without touching the text
  in the panes. The detail panel, which had carried a private run of pixel
  sizes that put its primary text at the size everything else uses for
  secondary text, is back on the same ladder as its neighbours, with mono a
  notch under the sans it pairs with.

- **A scrollback scrollbar down the right edge of a pane** — a pane's scroll
  position lives in rows of scrollback rather than pixels of laid-out content,
  so it had no handle to give a scrollbar. It now implements one over the grid
  and draws the same bar the sidebar and every list already use — same theme,
  same fade-out. The bar never drives the terminal: it records the row it
  wants and the next render applies it, clearing the sub-line remainder and
  cancelling an in-flight smooth scroll on the way. Scrollback piling up at the
  live edge is deliberately not reported, so a pane printing a build log does
  not hold a thumb on screen for as long as the output runs; every other
  change passes through, including the history shrinking. (#480, #432)

- **Zoom a pane's font with the platform modifier and the wheel** — holding
  Cmd (Ctrl off macOS) and scrolling over a terminal resizes the font instead
  of the scrollback, which is what you reach for when showing a pane to someone
  else. A wheel detent is one step whatever the platform bills it as, and a
  trackpad accumulates until the fingers have travelled three lines, so a flick
  does not run the font end to end. Steps go out as the existing
  increase/decrease actions, so the clamp and the saved setting stay in one
  place.

- **The command palette previews a theme while you arrow through the list** —
  picking a theme used to close the palette, so seeing what one looked like
  meant reopening it and retyping the search for every candidate. The
  highlighted row is now applied to the running window and the picker stays
  open: Return keeps it, Escape or any other way of closing puts the previous
  theme back. A preview only touches the in-memory config, so arrowing through
  the list never writes `config.json`, and the picker opens on the theme
  already in use so opening it changes nothing by itself.

- **The palette matches commands in every locale, not just the one on screen**
  — the filter only ever saw the label it was rendering, so a window running in
  Chinese answered "no matching commands" to `theme`. Each entry now carries
  every locale's wording of its key, plus the stable command id, as hidden
  search aliases: built once with the entry, never rendered, and scored just
  below a hit on the visible label so what you can actually read still comes
  first.

- **fish history joins the Ctrl+R menu and inline completion**, locally and on
  remote hosts. `fish_history` looks like YAML and is not — fish escapes only
  `\` and newline and quotes nothing, so a YAML reader silently drops every
  record holding a `: ` or a leading `[` and truncates anything with a ` #`,
  which is most conventional-commit messages. It is read with a line scanner
  shaped like fish's own reader instead. Each history file fetched from a
  remote host now carries the name it came from, so the far end's fish records
  reach the fish reader rather than arriving as literal `- cmd:` rows.
  Multiline entries are skipped rather than half-recalled. (#421)

- **The daemon upgrades in place instead of killing every shell** — picking up
  a new build used to mean stopping the daemon, and stopping the daemon takes
  every pane with it: the pty master is a descriptor that process holds, so its
  death raises SIGHUP on the shell, the agent and the half-finished command.
  The daemon now rewrites itself with `execve` on handoff — same pid, same
  children, same descriptors, same locks — writing what it knows about each
  pane into a blob and clearing `FD_CLOEXEC` on the ptys first. The restart
  Settings offers for a quiet moment is still there for the cases handoff
  cannot cover. (#449)

- **The tab sidebar elides labels tail-first and explains itself on hover** —
  a path keeps its leaf rather than its root, anything that is not a path keeps
  both edges, and a hover card spells out in full whatever the row had to hide:
  a renamed tab's real name, the terminal title behind a `Shell 3` placeholder,
  the remote host. The card is decided by comparing what the row rendered
  against what it rendered it from, so it never opens on a row that hid
  nothing. (#446)

- **The Info tab's rows do what they show** — the Session table used to render
  every fact the same inert way, with two unlabelled actions in a strip four
  rows below the path they acted on. A `changes` row is now the sidebar's green
  and red `+N −M` and opens the same diff overlay; an agent row wears the
  status dot its tab does; a port row hands over its address instead of leaving
  it to be retyped; and what a row can do appears at the end of it on hover, in
  the strip the Source Control rows already use. A port is only offered as
  `localhost` when localhost actually reaches it — a server bound to
  `172.17.0.1` is named by the address it really holds. (#531)

- **Closing a tab asks before it ends work that is still running** — ⌘W was the
  one action that permanently ended a shell in an app whose headline claim is
  that shells outlive it, and a mid-turn coding agent, a forty-minute build and
  an idle prompt all died identically and silently. Reopen Closed Tab was never
  an undo: it restores the layout with a *fresh* shell. Closing now asks once,
  naming what it would end, with Keep as the default button; an idle prompt
  still closes without a word. A pane counts as busy only when the shell is
  actually reporting, so a terminal without shell integration is not held
  hostage by a question it cannot answer. Close Other Tabs and Tabs to the
  Right skip anything that would raise a question rather than stacking one
  dialog per tab.

- **The opencode plugin reports its session id**, so a restarted pane can
  resume the same session with `opencode --session <id>`. It also maps
  `session.status` busy/idle for versions that no longer emit `session.idle`. A
  task-tool subagent runs in a child session whose events are structurally
  identical to the pane's own, so the bridge remembers child ids and lets their
  events pass without touching the pane's session — otherwise the pane would
  report and resume the subagent's session, and a subagent going idle would
  call the pane done. (#481)

- **A documentation site** — the docs are now a Mintlify site rather than a
  handful of Markdown files in the repository. (#478)

- **Drop files into the Files panel to copy them in** — the panel has always
  been a drag *source*; it now takes a drop as well. Files dragged in from the
  desktop land in the folder under the cursor: a folder row takes them itself,
  a file row stands in for the folder holding it, and the space below the tree
  belongs to the top of it. The landing is highlighted while the drag is in
  flight. Folders come in whole, the executable bit survives the copy, and a
  name already taken is asked about rather than silently replaced — a "no"
  leaves every file in the drop untouched, and a "yes" copies beside what is
  there and swaps the two only once the copy is whole, so a copy that fails
  partway leaves the original where it was. Two dropped items of the same
  name are one name and one file: the first keeps it and the second is
  refused, rather than landing on top of it with both reported as copied. It
  works over a remote workspace too, reading here and writing there, up to
  the size one control frame can carry; past that the panel says to use
  SFTP.

- **Rearrange splits by dragging a pane** — hovering a pane now floats a small
  grip along its top edge; dragging it moves that pane elsewhere in the tab.
  A drop on a pane's **side** goes in beside it: facing a neighbour in the same
  row or column it joins that row and takes an equal share of it, and only
  facing across the layout — where there is no row to join — does it split that
  pane in half. A drop on its **middle** trades the two panes' places, and a
  drop in the band past a pane's **outer side** — the one facing the window
  rather than another pane — puts it beside everything else as a full-width or
  full-height band, sized to an even share of what that side already holds — so
  a pane in the middle of a 2×2 becomes a full-height *third* column in a
  single drag rather than taking half the window. The landing is highlighted
  while the drag is in flight, and is only offered when the drop would actually
  change the layout. A pane dropped beside another is now reconciled with the
  machine tree as one `PaneMove` instead of a close-and-rebuild; a drop that
  lands beside a whole group of panes rather than beside a single one still
  takes the rebuild, which is all `PaneMove` can name.

- **Native Windows backdrop materials** — Settings → Appearance now offers a
  **Background material** picker on Windows (**Auto / Blur / Mica / Mica Alt /
  Acrylic / Off**) that maps onto the OS backdrop APIs: Mica and Mica Alt via
  `DWMWA_SYSTEMBACKDROP_TYPE`, Acrylic via the native
  `DWMSBT_TRANSIENTWINDOW` material on Windows 11 22H2+ (classic acrylic
  before that), and Blur via `ACCENT_ENABLE_ACRYLICBLURBEHIND`. The dropdown
  only lists the presets the current Windows build supports, the file
  sidebar and right detail panel follow the window opacity so the material
  shows through the whole workspace, and the settings panel stays opaque.
  macOS and Linux keep the existing blur toggle.

- **Panes come back showing what was on them after the background service dies
  unexpectedly** — a crash, a `kill -9` or a reboot takes the shells with it
  either way, but the screens no longer go with them. A capped tail of each
  pane's output is kept at `<config>/scrollback/*.bin` (0600 on unix, behind
  the config directory's ACL on Windows; 256 KiB per pane, written at most
  every 30s and only for panes whose output moved), and a pane that reopens on
  a dead predecessor's id is handed it. A planned restart already carried the
  live ptys across untouched; this covers the deaths nothing gets to prepare
  for. There is no switch: the moment anyone learns they wanted this is the
  moment a service has already died, so it is on for everyone. The bytes are
  dropped as soon as nothing can ask for them — closing a pane deletes its
  file at once, a restore consumes it, and a periodic pass collects the rest.
  A pane's shell is recorded alongside, so a git bash pane no longer comes
  back as PowerShell.

- **`tty7 wait` can wait for a command, not just an agent** — a new `free`
  state ends the wait when the pane's foreground command has exited and the
  pane is back to its bare shell, which is what a `cargo test` running in a
  pane has instead of an agent status. With `--changed` it means "something ran
  and then finished", the shape you want on the line after a `send`. It costs a
  second request per poll and so is only checked when you name it — and only
  when none of the agent states you named answered first, so `waiting,done,free`
  on a pane of unknown kind cannot lose you a `waiting`.

- **`tty7 send --key` presses keys instead of typing characters** — `C-c` to
  stop a runaway build, `escape` to close a TUI, `up`/`down`/`enter` to answer
  a permission prompt that takes no text. Repeatable for a sequence, composable
  with `TEXT`, and delivered as separate events 200 ms apart so a raw-mode TUI
  reads a sequence as a sequence rather than as a paste. An unknown key name is
  a usage error raised before anything is written.

- **`tty7 pane close` takes several panes, and `--orphans` clears the lot** —
  `pane ls --all` has been able to *show* the panes an interrupted `run` leaves
  behind; there was no way to act on that except by reading ids off the table
  one at a time. A pane that cannot be closed no longer abandons the rest of
  the batch.

- **`tty7 doctor` reports where the agent status hooks stand** — it has claimed
  to check hooks in its own `--help` for a while without doing so. Missing or
  outdated hooks are why an agent can look frozen in `tty7 agents` and why
  `tty7 wait` on it only ever times out, so the check belongs in the verb
  people run when something is not working.

- **SSH probes the `~/.ssh` default identity keys** — a connection with no
  identity file of its own used to offer the server nothing unless an agent
  was running, which on Windows is the common case (the OpenSSH
  Authentication Agent service is off by default), and then reported "no
  public key was accepted" when no key had ever been sent. `id_ed25519`,
  `id_ecdsa` and `id_rsa` now stand in for the identity list when the
  connection names no key of its own, the way `IdentityFile`'s default works
  in ssh_config — naming a key replaces them rather than adding to them. The
  agent is asked before either, because every public key offered spends one
  of the server's `MaxAuthTries` whether or not it is wanted, and the key the
  user loaded into the agent is the one most likely to work. A discovered key
  that is
  encrypted is used only when its passphrase is already in the OS keychain:
  russh has no offer-without-signing probe, so asking would spend a prompt on
  a key the server may not even want. A key named in the profile still asks,
  as before. The failure text now separates the two situations the old line
  papered over — keys the server rejected are named, and a round that offered
  nothing says where it looked. (#484)

- **A WSL pane gets its shell integration whatever the distro's shell is** —
  the bootstrap that runs inside the distro dispatches on `$SHELL`, and until
  now only bash had an arm of its own. A distro whose login shell is fish got
  one in #422; a zsh distro fell through to the catch-all and opened as a
  plain login shell, with no prompt marks and no working directory reported —
  so the inline editor never armed, and neither did anything else downstream
  of OSC 133. zsh now gets the same redirectors the native path writes,
  carried in over `WSLENV` and pointed at with `ZDOTDIR`. The bootstrap checks
  they are actually readable from inside the distro before trusting them: they
  live on the Windows side and arrive over `/mnt`, which a distro with
  automount off cannot see, and a `ZDOTDIR` aimed at nothing would start zsh
  with none of the user's own startup files at all. (#135)

- **Put your own entries in the new-tab menu** — `custom_shells` in
  `config.json` takes a list of `{label, program, args}`, and each one becomes a
  row in the menu behind the sidebar's **+**, after the shells tty7 detected. A
  distro, a container, a REPL, the same shell against a different profile: they
  are launched exactly as written, since tty7 chose none of the command and has
  no defaults to add to it — including its shell integration, so a custom entry
  opens without prompt marks or working-directory tracking even where the
  detected row beside it has both. `shell` still names the one command that
  stands in for the platform default; these are the rest. An entry with no
  `program` is
  skipped, one with no `label` is named after what it runs, and one that
  borrows a name already in the menu is marked `(Custom)` so the row telling
  you what a plain new tab opens with stays the only one wearing it. (#443)

### Changed

- **A Windows install for all users now updates itself** — previously an
  in-place update was refused there (replacing files under `C:\Program Files`
  takes administrator rights, and a silent installer launched unelevated would
  either install a second copy per-user or raise a bare UAC prompt from a
  temporary directory). The update now runs as one announced UAC prompt that
  covers both privileged stages, and the app itself never runs elevated: a
  helper running as the signed-in user waits the install out and relaunches
  tty7 with the user's own token. The update dialog says the prompt is coming
  before the app quits, and "Install on Next Launch" is not offered — nobody
  would be there to answer. Declining the prompt is not an error: the staged
  package simply waits in Settings. Everything the elevated half needs crosses
  as command-line arguments (an elevated child does not inherit the
  environment), the package's checksum travels from the release server in the
  GUI's memory rather than from a file the download could have rewritten, and
  the privileged stages always run the *installed* updater — a medium-integrity
  process cannot swap the binary that gets elevated. The staged copy lives in
  an administrator-only `%ProgramData%` directory while the chain runs (#504).
  Installations updated by an updater that predates the chain still fall back
  to the manual download page, so the first release carrying this updates the
  way it always did; the one after it updates itself.

- **Every confirmation answers the way the platform taught you it would** — the
  action button is on the right and Cancel on the left, through one shared
  helper. Answer 0 is drawn rightmost and takes Return, so the old
  `&[Cancel, Delete]` put Delete exactly where a decade of macOS trains people
  to click Cancel. Escape also cancels now, in all nineteen of them: gpui only
  binds it on a button declared as the cancel, and every call site had been
  passing plain strings.

- **A search match is washed in the theme's accent, at a strength the theme can
  afford** — the wash was drawn from the terminal palette's selection colour at
  a fixed 1.45:1 against the background, which is less than a hairline is worth
  spread over a whole cell, on a grid that is already grey on grey. The tint is
  now the accent, the one colour the terminal surface has nothing else in, and
  its strength is derived per theme from that palette's own text-contrast
  budget rather than from a constant that has to be safe for the worst
  palette. The current match drops its caret-coloured outline, which existed
  only because the fill could not say "this one" on its own. (#470)

- **The block cursor is drawn as reverse video** rather than as a 55% tint that
  halved whatever contrast the caret had. On a wide character it inverts the
  half holding the glyph.

- **An inactive pane dims by blending its terminal colours toward the window
  background** instead of being faded as a whole, and the fade is now worn by
  the terminal rather than by the pane — which is what keeps the grab grip
  legible on exactly the panes `dim_inactive_panes` fades, the ones being
  reached for. (#464)

- **The pane grip is three dots, the way Ghostty draws its own** — the bar a
  pane was picked up by grew and recoloured under the pointer and appeared
  whenever the pointer was anywhere in the pane at all: a mark on top of the
  terminal wherever the mouse rested, and a target that moved while being
  reached for. It is now three dots with 80×12 of reach around them and nothing
  between the two states but ink, asked for by the pane's top fifth rather than
  by the whole pane. The target is there for as long as the pane can be moved
  and only the dots come and go, so a pointer going straight for the top of a
  pane can press the grip on the frame it arrives; a 150 ms fade makes them
  read as arriving rather than blinking. (#463)

- **A WSL distro list comes from the registry rather than the WSL service** —
  `wsl -l -q` has to reach the service, and reaching the service is the part
  that can be slow, behind a hardcoded 3 s timeout that made the listing
  all-or-nothing. On a machine where one round trip takes 3.3 s the call timed
  out every time and no distro was ever offered in the shell menu: not slow,
  absent. `Lxss` is where `wsl.exe` registers them, nothing is listening on it,
  and it cannot hang; `wsl -l -q` stays as the fallback for when the key will
  not open at all. Distros are filtered by `State`, so a cancelled install or a
  failed `--import` no longer arrives in the menu and opens a pane that dies of
  a registration error.

- **Opening a WSL tab costs one probe instead of two** — every pane ran the
  readiness probe from the client and then the daemon ran the identical probe
  before opening the link: two rounds of five serial `wsl.exe` calls to learn
  one fact, and the client's copy threw its answer away and kept only the
  error. A distro also says once where its server is and is not asked again,
  rather than re-proving `uname`, `$HOME`, a stat and a liveness check on every
  pane. Measured on a distro already running and connected: 800 ms to open a
  tab, down to 440 ms — and on the machine in #454, where a round trip takes
  3.3 s, the duplicate alone was costing 15 s a tab.

- **`tty7 pane close --json` now reports `{"closed": [ids]}`** rather than a
  single `{"closed": id}`, because the verb takes more than one pane. A batch
  that could not close everything exits 1 with `{"closed": […], "failed": […]}`
  and the complaint on stderr, so a retry knows what is left.

### Fixed

- **Ctrl+C works in a pane on Windows again** — the daemon was created with
  `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, which disables Ctrl+C for the whole new group,
  and Windows hands that state down to every descendant. Every ConPTY shell a
  pane spawned inherited it and so did everything those shells ran: the pane
  wrote 0x03 and conhost turned it into a keypress, but the `CTRL_C_EVENT`
  never came, so `go run` and `npm install` carried on regardless. Git Bash
  looked fine only because MSYS synthesises SIGINT from the byte itself.
  `DETACHED_PROCESS` already left the daemon without a console for a control
  event to arrive on, so the group flag bought nothing to begin with; both
  daemon spawn paths and the headless CLI server now share one constant
  without it, and a pane clears any inherited ignore before it opens the pty,
  so a tty7 launched from a shell that already had the bit set is covered too.
  (#459, #451, #314)

- **Two tty7s on different config directories no longer erase each other's
  workspaces** — the machine tree resolved from `$HOME` while everything else
  an instance owns resolved from the config directory, so `--config-dir` moved
  every part of an instance except the one that says which workspaces exist.
  Two daemons, each holding its own lock and each certain it was the only
  server on the machine, co-owned one `machine.json`; the tree is written
  whole, so the second to flush replaced the first's workspaces with its own,
  and the next daemon to start read the survivor's tree as the machine's. An
  empty tree is indistinguishable from a machine that really has nothing on
  it, so the GUI did what an empty tree means and forgot those workspaces for
  good. A lock and the thing it protects have to be keyed alike. The daemon
  adopts a legacy file on startup so the move itself loses nothing, and only
  the instance running out of the config directory the machine resolves to on
  its own is entitled to that adoption — otherwise a default install beside a
  `--config-dir` one would rename the machine's tree into the wrong place.
  (#462)

- **A remote window that lost its first tree pull no longer sits empty until
  you restart** — a window opening onto a remote workspace is blank until the
  machine's tree is pulled and its tabs rebuilt, and a failed pull recorded a
  debt on the promise that the next sync would settle it. Nothing settled it:
  the hook that repays the debt ran for the local host and nowhere else, so on
  a remote machine only a full reconnect, an edit in the window, or restarting
  the app ever cleared it — and an empty window has nothing in it to edit. The
  window sat on the home page with every tab and every shell still alive on the
  machine. Both routine ways to fail a pull with a healthy link are covered
  now: a tree read that overruns its ten seconds, and a workspace create that
  loses a race with the priming pass running the same create from the other
  side of the same window opening — that one is no longer treated as a failure
  at all, the tree is simply read again. The retry is backed off, the backoff
  ends with the run of failures rather than with the next success, and a window
  left open on a machine that is really gone stops logging at warn once the
  backoff settles at its cap. (#472)

- **The macOS DMG builds again** — every release and nightly macOS job had been
  dying in packaging with `hdiutil: create failed - No space left on device`,
  after the build, the signing and the notarization had all succeeded. The
  runner's disk was never full: the path in the error is the image being
  created, so it was the volume that ran out. `hdiutil create -srcfolder` sizes
  the image from the bytes it is about to copy and does not cover what the
  filesystem spends carrying them, so a bundle that fits by measurement still
  runs the volume dry partway through. The room is asked for explicitly now —
  twice the content plus 64 MiB — and since the image is compressed on the way
  out the slack is nearly free: 127 MiB of empty volume costs about 672 KiB in
  the published DMG. This was a threshold rather than a cliff, which is why it
  began without anyone touching packaging. (#477, #476)

- **The CLI and the GUI agree on what exists** — five places where a workspace,
  a tab or an attachment was real on one side of the socket and invisible on
  the other, all rooted in the GUI keeping its own list of which workspaces
  exist and consulting the machine tree only for the ones already in it, so
  anything another client created was unreachable by construction. The switcher
  now lists workspaces the machine holds that this client has never opened, and
  opening one keeps its id instead of claiming a fresh one; opening a workspace
  hydrates from the machine's tabs rather than saving an empty session over
  them; a workspace removed with `ws rm` stays removed instead of being written
  back under the same id and haunting the switcher until a restart; `tty7 ls`
  can name the host holding a workspace; and `tab ls` / `ws tree` fall back
  through name, agent, cwd leaf and process name rather than showing a blank.
  (#423)

- **A pane the CLI created can be attached to** — a pane's owner names the
  workspace allowed to attach to it, and the CLI wrote a literal `tty7-cli`
  there for every pane it made. A window opening on a CLI-built workspace found
  none of them attachable: it spawned a fresh shell per tab, orphaned the live
  ones, and — because the tree still carried each pane's agent session — greeted
  the user with a failing `claude --resume <id>` in every one of them. Both
  spawn paths pass the workspace id now, and restore treats an unparseable
  owner as no claim at all, so panes stamped by an older CLI attach instead of
  stranding. `pane ls --all`'s OWNER column shows a dash when it agrees with
  WS, so what is left in it is exactly what is worth reading. (#425)

- **A WSL pane starts when the distro's default shell is fish** — `wsl.exe --`
  hands the command line to that default shell, which parsed the POSIX
  bootstrap before `sh` could receive it, so the pane never started at all.
  Every invocation carrying an argv goes out under `--exec` now. Those panes
  then came up with no shell integration, because the bootstrap only had a bash
  arm: no OSC 133 and no OSC 7, so no prompt marks, no exit status, no cwd, and
  `tty7 wait` and busy/idle status dead in the pane. There is a fish arm now,
  POSIX-quoted since `sh` parses the script rather than the user's own shell.
  (#422)

- **A remembered WSL server path repairs itself** — the note saying where a
  distro's server lives had no working way to be wrong: its only repair fired
  when spawning `wsl.exe` failed, and `wsl.exe` starts perfectly happily with a
  server path that no longer exists inside the distro. The exec failure arrives
  later as an EOF on the bridge, so a distro that was reinstalled or had its
  bin directory cleaned out failed every WSL tab from then on with no way out
  but restarting tty7. A bridge that closed without ever sending a byte never
  ran, and after one of those the next pane proves the distro again. The note
  is also read under the install lock now, so a window restoring panes can no
  longer spawn the binary that a server update is in the middle of replacing.

- **A half-read registry is no longer passed off as the distro list** — the
  walk ended on any non-zero return and reported what it had, but only one of
  those returns means "that was all of them"; the rest mean it stopped early,
  and a failure at the very first index came back as an authoritative "there
  are no distros". The sweep behind the shell menu keeps its last good list
  only when the probe declines to answer, so that empty answer erased the
  user's distros for the length of the TTL, with no error anywhere. The walk
  says nothing now unless it reached the end.

- **The Source Control panel is on the same font scale as the rest of the
  window** — the panel was cut from a branch that copied the right panel's size
  ramp hours before the interface font scale landed on main and moved that ramp
  onto rems. The two sides touched different files, so the merge had nothing to
  conflict over and the panel shipped a step small and deaf to `ui_font_size`
  entirely — its primary text at the size its neighbours use for secondary
  text, and a file row mixing a rem-sized status letter with a pixel-sized
  path. Every size a reader reads is a rem now; pixels stay on what type sits
  inside, and the row pitches and section heights grow with the type they hold.
  The commit body's fold also folds: `line_clamp` limits the wrapped lines
  within one logical line, and a commit message is the one string this panel
  draws that is always hard-wrapped, so a clamp of four over a thirty-line body
  laid out all thirty and Show more was a label with nothing behind it. It
  clips a height now. (#557)

- **A search highlight stays on its text while the pane is printing** — a match
  point is a line of the grid it was scanned from, so every line that scrolled
  off the top left each highlight washing the row its text had just left. The
  stored points now slide with the text on every wakeup. The rescan behind them
  was purely debounced, so a pane that never pauses — an agent streaming a
  reply — never got one at all: the count froze and the highlights sat on text
  that had since been rewritten in place. Output can now only push the deadline
  out so far. (#559)

- **A machine's name gets its own line in the switcher** — a group header drew
  the machine name and its `user@host:port` on one row, and the endpoint was a
  fixed-width item that claimed its space first, so a machine whose name ran
  long read as a stub: `y...`, `GAEM...`. Both the header and the "other
  machines" rows use the two-line shape the workspace rows under them already
  use, with the name backed by the full row width and the endpoint and link
  status underneath. Rows with neither stay single-line. (#560)

- **The stray guide rail under a remote machine is gone** — expanding one in
  the switcher drew a 1px vertical line left of the workspace avatars that
  local groups never drew, so it read as a stray mark rather than an indent
  guide, and it stopped short of the last row's midpoint leaving a dangling
  stub. Remote rows indent exactly like the SSH host rows below them now.
  (#536)

- **The workspace discs in the switcher are legible** — the monogram disc was
  drawn at 0.55 opacity on every row except the current workspace, and the
  initial inside it is already the foreground at 0.65, so the letter landed at
  about 0.36 and went illegible on exactly the rows the panel exists to let you
  choose between. The liveness dot is painted on the wrapper rather than inside
  the disc, so it never dimmed with it — a washed-out grey blob with a
  full-strength green dot stuck to its corner, which is what made the column
  look dirty rather than quiet. The dimming is gone; the current workspace was
  already saying so three louder ways. (#483)

- **Overlay scrollbars fade out again** — macOS reports that scrollbars should
  not auto-hide for anyone with a mouse plugged in, and that was turned into
  "always show" for every list in the app. The preference is about legacy
  scrollbars, which take a gutter out of the layout; tty7's are overlay bars
  painted on top of the content, so "always" parked an opaque bar over the
  switcher's tab column for as long as the panel stayed open, with nothing to
  fade it. (#471)

- **A tab label is cut on grapheme clusters, not on chars** — the sidebar's
  elision measures against real glyph widths but sliced by `char`, so it could
  satisfy every width check and still hand back a torn cluster: a
  zero-width joiner with nothing in front of it, a variation selector landing
  on the ellipsis, half a flag rendering as a bare letter. Scanning budgets
  from 30px to 200px over emoji fixtures, 48 widths produced output no font can
  render as intended. A tab title carrying an emoji is not exotic — plenty of
  TUIs and coding agents put one there. Widths are unchanged, since clusters
  are measured the same way chars were. (#450)

- **A multiline history entry draws on one menu row** — a command composed in
  the inline editor keeps its newlines when it goes into the in-session
  history, and gpui breaks text on `\n` whatever the white-space setting says,
  so one such entry painted a dozen lines inside a one-line row and covered the
  whole reverse-search menu. Line breaks are folded to a visible `↵` when
  drawing — one char for one char, so the fuzzy matcher's highlight positions
  still line up — and the stored entry is untouched, so recalling and running
  it are unchanged. (#436)

- **One Restart server button on the Settings page** — the in-place-update
  notice carried its own while the Server section right below it carried an
  identical one. The notice moved into that section, so the single button that
  ends every running pane is the only one on the page. (#452)

- **Several machines with outdated servers ask one question at a time** —
  reconnecting to them raised one native modal per machine in a single pass,
  stacked on each other, each about a machine the one in front of it did not
  name. The queue is walked one question at a time now, and if the window goes
  away with a question open the rest go back on the queue instead of being
  swallowed.

- **Gestures that did nothing at all** — a pass over the whole app, most of it
  found by driving the UI rather than by reading the code:

  - **Escape in a confirmation dialog** cancels, in all nineteen of them.
  - **⌘P then Return** now runs the first row. The list started with nothing
    selected and only picked a row when a *query* changed, so nothing showed
    what Return was aimed at.
  - **The palette's `→ edit` badge** is `⌘E`. Neither advertised gesture could
    fire — `→` is eaten by the query field and `⌘↵` by Enter Full Screen — so a
    saved SSH profile could not be opened for editing from the palette at all.
  - **⌘G past the last match** wrapped to match 1 and left it behind the
    floating search bar, reading "1/3" with nothing visible. The bar's rows
    count as off screen now.
  - **`ls | gre` + Tab** completes `grep` rather than filenames. The
    command-position test was "everything before the cursor is whitespace",
    true only at the very start of the line; over SSH it also spent a round
    trip listing the remote cwd to do it. Same for `a && b` and `a; b`.
  - **Typing or pasting while scrolled back** snaps the view to the prompt, so
    your own keystrokes are not landing off screen.
  - **Typing into a filled text box** — rename, prompts — replaces the text
    instead of prepending to it. Every one of them opens with its contents
    selected.
  - **Double-clicking a file over SFTP** opens it; only folders used to
    respond.
  - **Tab inside the palette** stays in the palette, and in the switcher
    crosses to the tab column, instead of escaping to the next focusable
    button.
  - **Reveal in Finder on a remote workspace** is hidden rather than handing
    the local file manager a path on another machine. Copy Path stays.

- **Things that failed silently now say so** — theme writes, theme
  duplication, opening the themes folder, a server restart, a session restore
  that came back short, an unparseable theme file, an SFTP overwrite, a search
  count that hit its ceiling, a file-tree search that hit its ceiling, a delete
  that did not go through, SSH auth with nothing to try, and an unknown action
  in a keymap each either did nothing visible or blamed something else. All of
  them now report what happened and, where there is one, what to do. The
  sidebar's diff count no longer disagrees with the diff it opens, a
  filtered-out SFTP directory is no longer called empty, and the theme picker
  says when its filter matched nothing.

- **A directory with no children says which kind of nothing it is** — the
  listing error was discarded, so a folder the OS refused rendered
  byte-identically to one that really is empty and to one still being read. An
  expanded directory now draws Reading…, Empty, Only hidden files, or Could not
  be read; arrow-key navigation skips those placeholders because they are not
  files. The tree column and the tab sidebar get the same treatment when a
  filter drops everything.

- **Layout and hit targets** — the settings pages, the diff overlay, the
  Markdown preview, the SFTP transfers list and the switcher's columns all
  scrolled with no scrollbar and now have the one the rest of the app has. The
  split divider takes an 8px grab, the same as the panel edges. Icon-only
  buttons across the chrome get a 24×24 target without changing how they look,
  and their tooltips print the chord. The active tab and the New Tab button
  stay on the tab strip instead of scrolling out of reach. The switcher card
  fits inside the window it floats over, and the window itself has a minimum
  size. Below about 1000px the SSH host form stacks each control onto its own
  line — rows measure the width they will actually get — rather than squeezing
  the label column toward a letter per line and pushing Connect and the 2FA
  option off screen. Nothing moves above the breakpoint.

- **Contrast, colour and theming** — button labels, panel headings, tooltips,
  menus, the command line and the splitters are drawn in the active preset's
  own colours instead of ignoring it. Sidebar text, carets, hairlines and the
  semantic inks that bypassed the contrast machinery are floored, and a
  hairline is worth the same in every theme. Three faded states had two values
  each, the app had two transition curves, and the theme card rounded unlike
  the panel it sits in: one value, one duration and curve, one radius.

- **An agent's state is not carried by hue alone** — Working, Needs input and
  Done were a hue on a nine-pixel dot with no shape, label or tooltip
  anywhere, and the pair that decides whether you go and look is amber versus
  green, which is the pair red-green colour vision separates worst. Needs input
  draws as a ring rather than a filled dot, the tab avatar has a tooltip naming
  the agent and its state in all three locales, and a brand disc that lands
  within 1.25:1 of the window fill — Codex and Grok both ship a pure black one,
  which dissolves on a dark theme and leaves a white glyph floating — gets a
  hairline.

- **The palette stops showing recent commands twice** — the zero-query list
  pushed a Recent section and then pushed every group containing those same
  commands, so the five rows you use most were the five rows shown twice.
  Promoting to Recent moves a command now rather than cloning it, and a group
  left empty drops its header with it. Ranking also threw frecency away the
  moment a character was typed, so the command someone runs every day stopped
  floating exactly when they started reaching for it; a bounded bonus rides
  along with the match score — enough to separate two comparable matches, not
  enough to let a well-worn command outrank a plainly better one.

- **SFTP transfers stop writing over files without a word** — downloading the
  same file twice overwrote the first copy and uploading into the folder on
  screen overwrote whatever was already there, neither with any warning and
  neither recoverable. A download lands as `name (2).ext` the way a browser
  does, still in one click; an upload asks once, naming what it would replace.
  The upload check reads the listing already on screen rather than making a
  round trip to ask.

- **Escape no longer throws away an unsaved SSH connection** — editing a
  profile and pressing Escape closed Settings and discarded the form. Whether
  the form was dirty was already known — it is what enables Save — but was only
  used to grey out a button. Escape, the close button and ⌘, ask now, with Keep
  Editing as the default. The nineteen rows of SSH Advanced also carry six
  quiet headings — Authentication, Proxies, Algorithms, Connection, Session,
  Security — of two to four rows each; no row moved, the existing order already
  grouped this way and never said so.

- **Settings search marks what it counted** and scrolls the page to the hit,
  including when the hit is a section header. Background images, Compression
  and four other settings that were missing from the index are in it, and a
  query that matches nothing on the current page no longer greys out a page you
  are simply reading.

- **Copy, i18n and discoverability** — every failure opens with "Could not", as
  most already did; every popup menu is in the Title Case the rest use; the
  background server has one name everywhere; settings labels are sentence case;
  and no Markdown backticks are printed at the user. The terminal's right-click
  menu was the last surface still hardcoded English in a three-locale app, and
  it also used a fourth name for actions the menu bar, palette and Keybindings
  already agree on. Chinese quotes names the way Chinese quotes them, Japanese
  descriptions end the way the other eighty do, the 16 ANSI colours are named
  rather than numbered, and the remote Files search box re-translates on a
  language switch. The i18n parity test was a hand-maintained 900-line copy of
  the key list and now sweeps a generated one, with a documented allow-list for
  the keys that stay English — and the untranslated-string guard actually
  guards. Completion specs got git's missing descriptions filled in, cargo's
  `--color` described like the other 41, and a rustup flag that described
  itself fixed; a candidate says when its description was cut. The Keybindings
  page is grouped by command group, SSH is reachable from the menu bar, "Enter
  Full Screen" no longer appears twice, ⌘W names the command it is about to
  end, and the View menu teaches the right key for Zoom Pane.

- **Switching workspaces no longer wipes the tab titles of the one you left** —
  in the switcher, the workspace the window was showing had properly named tabs
  while every other one read "Claude Code", over and over, for as many tabs as
  it had. The two columns come from two sources: a window names its own tabs
  from its live terminals' OSC titles, and every workspace it does not own it
  reads out of the machine tree — which recorded each pane's foreground
  *process* name and never the terminal's title, so the naming fell through to
  the next best thing it had, the agent. Switching a workspace happens in place
  and drops the terminals the window was reading, so the workspace you just
  left went from named tabs to a column of identical rows. The daemon now
  records the title a pane sets (OSC 0 and 2, capped at 256 characters) in the
  tree beside its cwd, and the switcher shows it, put through the same
  abbreviation the tab strip uses so a shell's `user@host:~/dir` reads `…/dir`
  in both places. In a split, the pane running an agent names the tab rather
  than whichever shell happens to be first. `tty7 tab ls` and workspaces listed
  on a remote machine were reading the same missing field, and are named the
  same way now.

- **A WSL distro that cannot reach `/mnt` keeps its own `.bashrc`** — the
  bootstrap handed bash a `--rcfile` living on the Windows side without
  checking the distro could read it. bash ignores an unreadable `--rcfile`
  without a word, and tty7 starts it non-login precisely so that `--rcfile` is
  honoured at all — so a distro with automount off, or a root moved by
  `wsl.conf`, opened a shell that had read no startup file the user wrote: not
  tty7's, and not their `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` either. The arm now checks
  first and falls back to a plain login shell, which reads the same startup
  files a pane without shell integration reads and only gives up the
  integration.

- **An idle window stops re-reading the repository on Linux** — with a
  repository open, tty7 ran `git status -uall` about two and a half times a
  second, forever, with nothing on screen changing and nobody touching the
  machine. The filesystem watch was feeding itself: Linux reports opening a
  file as a watch event, every read of `.git` is an open, and reading `.git`
  is exactly how the watch's own events were answered — so each answer
  scheduled the next question. Reads are no longer mistaken for changes;
  a write finishing still is. macOS and Windows were never affected, which is
  why this survived so long.

- **An alias put back in an `Include`d ssh config file is found again** — the
  check behind a parked remote workspace watched `~/.ssh/config` for changes
  and nothing else, but `Include` is common and editing an included file
  leaves the including file's timestamp exactly where it was. So re-adding a
  `Host` block where it used to live changed nothing: the workspaces on that
  alias stayed parked, with no retry and no error, saying a new profile would
  find them again — which is what the user had just done. Every file the parse
  reads is watched now, and the root config even when it could not be read, so
  one appearing later is noticed too.

- **A rejected stored credential asks again instead of failing forever** — a key
  passphrase saved with "remember" was written to the keychain before the daemon
  had tried it, and a wrong one then ended every later connection at "could not
  decrypt identity file" with no prompt at all: the key was unusable and nothing
  in the app could clear the entry. Keyboard-interactive had the matching hole,
  replaying a stale saved password on every reconnect, because OpenSSH ends a
  rejected request with a plain failure rather than another question. The daemon
  now says which secret was refused, both paths ask again, and an answer given
  without "remember" forgets the stale entry — the self-heal the password path
  has always had. Deleting a host profile also stops stranding its key
  passphrases in the keychain, and a prompt raised for a remote workspace now
  carries the real user, host and port instead of filing everything under port
  22.

- **A host key of a new algorithm is no longer reported as a compromise** — a
  server that grew an ed25519 key beside the ssh-rsa one it had always had was
  met with the full man-in-the-middle sheet: fingerprint diff, type `yes` to
  override. Worse, negotiation always led with ed25519 rather than with what was
  on file, so a host known only by an ssh-rsa key raised that alarm on every
  single connection. The algorithms already in `known_hosts` are now offered
  first, the way OpenSSH's own ordering does it, so the question usually never
  comes up; when it does it is the ordinary "a key you have not seen" confirm,
  naming the algorithm the host is already known by. A key that contradicts one
  on file still raises the alarm, and overriding it now removes the superseded
  line instead of leaving the rejected key trusted for good.

- **The "Override" button on a changed host key overrides** — it submitted the
  same refusal the Abort button sends whenever the field did not read exactly
  `yes`, so clicking it, or typing a stray character first, closed the sheet and
  quietly abandoned the connection. It is now disabled until the confirmation is
  typed, says so once there is something in the field, and Enter no longer
  abandons the connection either.

- **One account of whether a machine is connected** — the window's memory of a
  manual attempt used to outrank the supervisor that actually holds the links,
  in every place the two were consulted. Taking a workspace back from another
  client flipped the status to Attached and re-enabled input without ever
  sending the attach, so keystrokes went into a socket the far end had given
  away; a link brought up from the switcher never attached anything at all; a
  failed connect owned the status strip of every remote window, including
  windows on other machines, until it was dismissed by hand; and a machine being
  retried in the background was drawn as one nobody had ever connected to, its
  workspaces folded out of the switcher, with the reason for the last failure on
  screen for a quarter of a second before being overwritten. The supervisor is
  now the only account: the reclaim is really sent and undone if it is refused,
  a stale failure is retired the moment the link comes up, and a retry says
  which attempt it is on and what went wrong last time.

- **A failed SFTP poll no longer reads as an empty transfer list** — a poll that
  could not reach the daemon returned no jobs, which is the same answer as
  having none: the transfer tray disappeared and every upload the panel was
  waiting on was counted as landed. Over a link that is down that was the
  permanent answer, not a blink. A failed poll now keeps the transfers it cannot
  see, settles nothing, and says so in the tray.

- **A port forward whose loop has exited stops reporting Listening** — the
  status was written once when the forward was set up and never again, so a
  forward whose accept loop had already gone reported itself as healthy for as
  long as the pane stayed open — which is indefinitely, because a pane is
  deliberately not closed when its SSH connection dies. The loop now records why
  it left, and the panel shows it.

- **A file-tree search that failed says so** — an unreachable host, or a search
  the host refused, drew "Nothing matches" — indistinguishable from a search
  that ran and found nothing, and every bit as convincing. It now says the
  search failed. Creating or renaming a file through the tree also stops
  reporting a bare `Permission denied (os error 13)` and names the file and the
  operation, the way deleting one already did.

- **A port-forward edit cannot lose the rule it replaces** — saving an edit
  removed the old rule before adding the new one, so an edit onto a port already
  in use ended with the working forward gone and nothing in its place. The old
  rule is now put back when the new one cannot start, and the form stays open
  with the reason. Add and Save also stop doing nothing in silence: an
  unparseable bind port, a missing target host or a target port of 0 used to be
  a button that did not respond, and now disables itself and says which field is
  wrong. A forward request that never reaches the session no longer empties the
  panel either.

- **A half-filled SSH profile is refused rather than saved** — the form saved
  whatever was in it. An empty host became a blank, unidentifiable row in the
  host list and reached the socket layer as a DNS error about a name nobody had
  typed, because Connect had no gate at all. A mistyped jump host was silently
  dropped and saved as a direct connection. `proxy.example.com` with no port,
  and `proxy.example.com:88O` with a bad one, both saved a proxy on port 0 and
  failed much later, somewhere else. Each complaint now prints under its own
  field and disables Save and Connect: the host is required (a name is not, and
  a blank port still means 22), an unknown or self-referential jump host is
  named out loud, and a proxy address with no port takes the scheme's default —
  1080 or 8080 — rather than none at all. A proxy already saved on port 0 is
  read as no proxy.

- **An ssh config import says what it did** — the button was silent three ways
  over: a missing or unreadable file did nothing, a file naming no importable
  hosts did nothing, and a clean import of six hosts also did nothing visible.
  It now reports each of those, with counts of the hosts added, updated and
  already current, and names the options tty7 has no field for — `IdentityAgent`,
  `CertificateFile`, `IdentitiesOnly` and the rest — grouped with the hosts that
  set them, so a host that behaves differently under tty7 than under `ssh` has
  something to point at.

- **"Forget Password" asks first, and says who else it signs out** — one click
  deleted the keychain entry, irreversibly and without a word. The entry belongs
  to the endpoint rather than the profile, so forgetting from one host also
  signed out every other profile reaching the same `user@host:port` — a direct
  connection and one through a jump host, say — and that only turned up as an
  unexpected password prompt on a host nobody had touched. It now confirms, and
  when the endpoint is shared the dialog says how many others go with it.

- **The Files tree follows an agent into a git worktree** — the pane's cwd row,
  the tab sidebar and the source control panel all track where a coding agent
  is actually working, because an agent reports its own directory over the hook
  stream. The file tree was the one panel still reading the foreground
  process's cwd, and an agent that moves into a worktree never `chdir`s — so
  `claude` entering `.claude/worktrees/feature` left the tree rooted in the
  main checkout, disagreeing with the path printed directly above it.

- **`tty7 wait` no longer calls a busy shell `idle`** — a pane with nothing
  reporting agent status was reported as `idle`, so `tty7 wait %3 --until idle`
  returned success immediately, `matched: true`, about a pane that was midway
  through a build. Those panes now report `no-agent`, which is both true and
  the signal to use `--until free` instead; a wait that times out there says so.

- **Deleting an SSH profile no longer strands its remote workspaces** — the
  switcher kept every entry that had connected through the profile, labelled
  with a bare internal id, retrying a route that could never work again. The
  confirmation now names the profile's endpoint and counts the entries going
  with it, and deleting forgets those bookmarks along with the profile and its
  keychain credentials — *forgets*, not deletes: the sessions on the remote
  machine are untouched, and connecting to it again under a new profile brings
  its workspaces back from the machine's own list. An entry holding a live or
  in-flight connection is left alone, and parks once the link drops: it stops
  retrying, keeps the name of the route that made it rather than the id, and
  its switcher row offers *Remove entry* next to a note that a new profile
  finds the session again.

- **Opening a folder from Explorer no longer costs you your layout** — "Open in
  tty7", "Open tty7 here", and `tty7 <PATH>` restore the last window's tabs and
  splits before opening the folder as one more tab in it. A launch naming a
  directory used to skip the restore outright whenever no window was already
  up — whatever "Restore last layout" said — so the folder arrived as a lone
  blank terminal and the previous tabs were left behind, still running on the
  server but reachable only through the workspace switcher. With a window
  already up the same menu entry had always just added a tab, which is the
  behavior both shapes of launch now share. A path still declines to follow the
  layout onto a remote machine and starts a fresh local workspace there, since
  the directory it names is a path on this computer.

- **An SFTP upload no longer sits in the browser under its temporary name** —
  an upload is written as `<name>.tty7-upload-<hex>` and renamed into place at
  the end, and the browser listed the directory the moment the transfer
  started, catching exactly that name. Nothing listed again afterwards, so a
  finished upload read as a file with a hash glued to its name until the
  directory was navigated by hand. The premature listing is gone and the
  directory is listed once the upload stops running — finished, failed or
  cancelled.

- **Drag cursors on Windows** — the grip on a pane's top edge, and a sidebar
  group being dragged, now change the pointer on Windows too. Win32 ships no
  open- or closed-hand cursor and gpui answers both with the plain arrow, so
  the grip read as ordinary background and a drag in flight gave the pointer
  nothing to say; both now use the pointing hand there, and hovering the grip
  no longer hands the cursor back to the arrow the moment the drag it
  advertised begins.

- **A failed update install says so instead of asking again** — the GUI hands
  the install to the `tty7-updater` helper and quits, so a failure inside the
  helper used to reach only `update.log`: the old version relaunched with no
  word about it, and because the prompt state had already been cleared, the
  next check offered the very same version again — and again. The helper now
  records the terminal outcome of every attempt (`update-outcome.json` next
  to `update.json`) — before relaunching the previous app, so the relaunched
  GUI finds it already on disk — and the GUI folds it into the update state at
  startup: Settings shows the failure with the installer's own reason until
  dismissed, and the version asks again only after the same three-day
  reminder "Later" uses rather than on the next launch, so one failed install
  neither nags nor quietly retires the version. The same channel carries the
  success case, so a failure an earlier attempt recorded is retired by the
  update that did land. As part of this the helper takes the config directory
  as a `--config-dir` argument rather than through the environment, which an
  elevated child process would not inherit (#540).

## [26.8.2] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **Update tty7 without leaving the app** — the launch check and
  **Settings → About → Check Now** now offer **Update and Relaunch** instead of
  sending the user to GitHub Releases. A dedicated `tty7-updater` helper
  verifies the release checksum, the bundle version, and — on macOS — the
  code-signing requirement before replacing the installation, and restores the
  previous copy if the relaunch fails. The update is fetched and verified while
  the prompt is up, so installing it is a restart; declining defers it rather
  than retiring it.

  On macOS the new GUI reuses a running local server when its wire protocol is
  compatible, preserving shells; an incompatible server keeps its shells too and
  raises the existing explicit keep-or-restart prompt. Windows cannot replace a
  running daemon's image, so its install path stops the service and the dialog
  says so. Layouts that cannot be updated in place — notably an all-users
  `C:\Program Files` install, where running Setup as the signed-in user would
  either install a second copy beside the real one or put a bare UAC prompt in
  front of a user whose GUI just vanished — keep the release-page fallback.
  (by @ayamir in #309, by @ArnoChenFx in #330)

- **Stable and Nightly are separate update channels** — the channel is a
  property of the installation rather than something inferred from how version
  numbers sort, so a Nightly build follows Nightly instead of being walked back
  onto Stable by an update it never asked for. Stable reads `/releases/latest`,
  which excludes prereleases; Nightly reads `/releases/tags/nightly`. Neither
  feed can hand the other an update, so an installation only changes channel
  when the user changes it in Settings.

  The nightly release cannot state its version in its tag — `nightly` is
  force-moved every night, so `tag_name` is the literal string — so it now
  publishes `nightly.json` beside the packages, falling back to parsing asset
  filenames for builds that predate the manifest. Prereleases are ordered by
  every numeric identifier in the stamp, and the stamp goes to the minute so two
  builds in one day are distinguishable; a stable release still outranks every
  dated build of its core version, which is how switching back to Stable
  graduates rather than downgrades. Switching channel invalidates what the old
  feed produced: the staged package, the deferred prompt, and any transfer still
  in flight. Skipping a version is retired along with its state and its Settings
  row. (#386)

- **A proxy for tty7's own network traffic** — update checks, release downloads
  and remote-server installs now resolve an HTTP/SOCKS proxy from, in order, a
  new `http_proxy` config field, the platform system proxy (Windows registry,
  macOS `SCDynamicStore`), and `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY`.
  Programs running in a pane are deliberately unaffected — they inherit their
  proxy from their own environment, as in any other terminal.
  (by @shihuaidexianyu in #367, reported in #365)

- **`tty7 wait` — the primitive an agent team was missing** — block until a
  pane's agent needs input, finishes its turn, or dies:
  `tty7 wait %3 --until waiting,done --changed --timeout 600`. The daemon
  already tracked, per pane, which coding agent runs there and its status
  (idle / working / **waiting on the user** / done, plus the agent's native
  session id), but the only consumer was the GUI's status dots. This hands
  the same view to programs: one agent can start a worker in another pane,
  sleep until its peer blocks on a permission prompt, answer it, and read
  the result — which a tmux-based agent team has to fake by screen-scraping
  `capture-pane` on a timer.

  The status the server keeps is a *level*, not an event: `done` stands
  until the next turn begins, `waiting` until the agent moves again. So
  `--changed` is not optional dressing — it ignores the state the pane was
  already in when the wait began, which is what every round after the first
  needs. Without it, a wait issued right after a `send` answers with the
  *previous* turn's state before the worker has even read the input; the
  JSON's `stale` flag says when that happened. Exit codes are made for
  scripts: `0` matched, `124` timed out (the `timeout(1)` convention), `1`
  with `"status": "exit"` when the worker died before it could get there.
  The reply carries the agent's message and native session id, so a wake-up
  is directly actionable.

  Polling `AgentStates` rather than subscribing to events, on purpose: a
  stateless question composes into scripts (`tty7 wait %3 && tty7 capture %3
  --plain`), survives a server restart mid-wait, and needs no cursor. The
  cost is one aggregate request per tick — the same one `tty7 agents` makes
  once. (by @yetone in #248)

- **An agent-facing skill for the CLI** — the repo carries
  [`skills/tty7`](skills/tty7/SKILL.md), which teaches a coding agent the
  verbs above: work out which pane it is sitting in, split one, send a task
  into another, capture what came back, run a command in a real PTY and pass
  its exit code through. You install it yourself, with
  `npx skills add l0ng-ai/tty7` — tty7 writes nothing into `~/.claude` for
  it, and there is no switch in Settings that does.

  A skill rather than a global instruction, on purpose: an earlier cut
  appended this guidance to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, which taxed every
  session's context window and, worse, encouraged *every* agent to go drive
  its neighbours. As a skill, only its one-line description rides in context
  until something explicitly reaches for it.

- **Smooth scrolling for wheel mice** — a notch now eases into place over a
  handful of frames instead of jumping the whole distance at once.
  **Settings → Terminal → Scrolling → Smooth scrolling**, on by default.

  Sub-line scroll positions have been in place for a while: the view keeps a
  fractional remainder and paints the grid shifted by it, so the scrollback
  need not land on a line boundary. But the position was a function of the
  *event*, not of *time* — a notch arrived and the whole thing was applied at
  once. Whether that looked smooth came down entirely to how fine-grained the
  platform's deltas were. A macOS trackpad reports pixels, so it did. A wheel
  on Windows reports whole lines (gpui multiplies the notch by the system's
  scroll-lines setting, three by default), the fraction came out zero every
  time, and the view jumped three lines per notch — the sub-line machinery was
  present and never engaged. That is the "no smooth scroll on Windows" report.

  macOS was no better, just differently broken: it reports a wheel mouse as
  *pixels* too — `hasPreciseScrollingDeltas` is set — so the fraction was never
  zero, but one detent arrives as a single ~103px event, which at a 21px line
  height is a five-line jump applied in one go. Worse than Windows, and
  invisible to any check based on the delta's type.

  A wheel detent is one discrete pulse; no amount of arithmetic on the delta
  recovers a continuous gesture from it. So the fix is to make position a
  function of time: a detent adds to a remaining distance, and each frame
  consumes a share of what is left. Roughly 120ms to land, exponential, so most
  of the travel happens immediately and the tail is invisible — under a pixel
  of remainder is snapped rather than approached, since every frame of it costs
  a repaint.

  Trackpads keep the direct path; putting an animation between the fingers and
  the grid would only add lag. What separates the two is **phase**, not delta
  type and not delta size — measured on this machine, a trackpad flick moves up
  to ~3 lines in one event while an inched wheel moves ~0.6, so size overlaps
  badly, but only a device that can gesture ever reports `Started`/`Ended`, and
  a wheel is `Moved` forever on every platform. The gesture is then held open
  on a 150ms idle timer rather than closed on `Ended`, because lifting the
  fingers is not the end of the stream: the momentum tail keeps delivering
  `Moved` events *larger* than the gesture itself, and animating those would
  smooth what the system is already smoothing.

  Two more things stay direct. A jump under a line reads as continuous already
  — inching a wheel one detent at a time lands there — and mouse reporting and
  alternate-scroll forward whole lines to the application, which cannot be
  spread over frames at all.

  The distance in flight is relative, not an absolute target, so output
  arriving mid-scroll shifts the grid without dragging the animation somewhere
  else. Everything that moves the view on its own — jumping to a prompt,
  dragging a selection past the edge, clearing the scrollback, the keyboard and
  mouse-reporting paths — cancels what is in flight first. (#382)

- **The GUI speaks English, Simplified Chinese and Japanese** — every string in
  the interface now goes through a locale table, selected by **Settings →
  General → Language**. The menu bar, command palette, switcher, settings,
  SFTP panel, file tree, diff overlay, toasts, SSH prompts and confirmations are
  all translated, with plural- and select-aware helpers where a count or a
  gender-free choice is involved. The `zh` and `ja` key tables are exhaustive,
  so adding an `L10nKey` fails the build until it is translated rather than
  silently rendering English.

  Two things stay in English on purpose. A theme's name is data, not chrome —
  it is written into the theme YAML and matched back by suffix, so translating
  it forked "Nord" into a Chinese name that then stacked a second suffix on the
  next fork and stayed Chinese after switching the GUI back. And the words
  Chinese developers read and speak in English anyway — hook, agent, worktree,
  diff, fork, shell, pane, server — are left alone; translating them lost more
  than it gained. Language names in the picker stay endonyms (English /
  简体中文 / 日本語) in every locale.
  (by @shihuaidexianyu in #303, by @cwatanab in #372)

- **Oh My Pi (`omp`) is a first-class agent** — the eighteenth CLI tty7
  recognizes in a pane, with the full set: brand avatar, status dot, session
  resume (`omp --resume <id>`), and **Fork Session** (`omp --fork <id>`).
  **Settings → Agents** installs its hooks like the others.

  Oh My Pi is a fork of Pi, but it is its own binary with its own
  `~/.omp` config directory, so it gets its own entry rather than sharing
  Pi's — a pane running `omp` was previously not detected at all, and
  aliasing it onto Pi would have written the bridge to `~/.pi` and offered
  `pi --session <id>` to a binary that spells it `--resume`. The status
  bridge is the Pi extension the fork inherited (same default-exported
  factory, same four lifecycle events), so one template now serves both,
  landing at `~/.omp/agent/extensions/tty7/index.ts`.
  (#405, reported by @Hanser0521 in #376)

- **The switcher is two columns, and Ctrl+Tab raises it** — it listed
  workspaces only, so reaching a tab inside one meant opening the workspace
  first. Now workspaces sit on the left and the tabs of whichever one the cursor
  is on sit to the right, and Ctrl+Tab raises the panel as a most-recently-used
  tab switcher that commits when the modifier comes up, the way IDEA does it.

  Picking a workspace or a tab switches this window in place; a second window is
  something you ask for, with the platform modifier or **Open in New Window**,
  rather than what happens by default. New workspaces also get a codename
  ("amber-yak") instead of inheriting whatever directory their first shell
  started in. (#380)

- **Every shell tty7 can find is in the new-terminal menu, plus one you name** —
  the menu lists the shells detected on this machine (Nushell included, on every
  platform) and a configurable custom entry with its own arguments, which
  survive across shell-inventory rescans. (by @ArnoChenFx in #311)

- **Windows Explorer context menus** — an optional **Open in tty7** verb for a
  directory background and for a folder, registered from the installer rather
  than from Settings: writing shell verbs is an install-time decision, which is
  where VS Code and Git for Windows put theirs. A task checkbox drives new
  `--register-explorer-menu` / `--unregister-explorer-menu` flags, so the key
  layout stays in `core::explorer_context_menu` instead of being copied into the
  `.iss`. The uninstaller unregisters unconditionally, so an install that
  registered once and was later upgraded without the box ticked does not leave
  keys pointing at a deleted exe. (by @ArnoChenFx in #310, #350)

- **`tty7` opens directories in new tabs** — the CLI accepts one or more
  directories and opens a tab per directory in the running GUI, restoring a
  window if none is open. Paths that do not round-trip through UTF-8 are
  rejected rather than opened somewhere else. (by @ArnoChenFx in #308)

- **A bell that both flashes and rings** — `BellMode` gained a `Both` variant
  alongside `None`, `Visual` and `Audible`, exposed as a fourth option under
  **Settings → Terminal → Bell**. Existing `none` / `visual` / `audible` config
  values are unchanged. (by @shihuaidexianyu in #357)

- **Desktop notifications you can click** — a notification now carries the pane
  it came from, and clicking it reveals that pane's window, tab and split.
  Windows shows a WinRT toast with an `Activated` handler, macOS uses
  mac-notification-sys' click response, and both route through the existing tray
  dispatch channel; Linux keeps the plain notify-rust path. Titles gained
  context — an agent name or the machine, then the workspace — and bodies name
  the command or agent alongside the duration, all of it translated. Notification
  text is sanitized on every path: it comes off the terminal, and a stray
  control byte used to make the Windows toast XML fail to parse and lose the
  notification outright. (by @shihuaidexianyu in #373)

- **The bright half of the ANSI palette is rescued when a theme makes it
  illegible** — bright colors that fall under the contrast floor on the theme
  background are lifted to it, behind a setting so a theme that means it can opt
  out. (by @ArnoChenFx in #413)

### Changed

- **The About page is about the app again** — it had grown three sections that
  change system state and that nobody looks for under "About": a PATH install, a
  registry write, and a daemon restart. The `tty7` CLI toggle moves to
  **Agents**, which already describes tty7 ↔ agent integration in the other
  direction (hooks reporting session status). The Windows Explorer context menu
  moves to the installer. Server restart stays — it is about the app itself.

  What is left is trimmed to what it is for: the marketing paragraph goes, the
  update and server explanations drop from multi-sentence accounts of internals
  to one line each, the tech credits move to the bottom, and the update toggle
  renders with `settings_row` like every other switch. Eight strings the page
  had skipped are now localized. (#350, #358)

- **The close-confirmation setting is gone** — closing a window with live panes
  always confirms. (#383)

- **The Outline right panel is gone** — with all of its wiring: the tab, the
  action, the palette command, the keymap arm and four i18n keys. An existing
  config value of `outline` falls back to the default Info tab, and a user
  keybinding naming `ShowRightPanelOutline` degrades to a logged warning rather
  than breaking the keymap. (#375, requested by @shihuaidexianyu in #374)

- **Chinese terminology, corrected throughout** — the worst one collided two
  concepts: a git worktree was translated as 工作区, the same word tty7 uses for
  a workspace, so "Remove Worktree" read as "delete this workspace" inside a
  destructive confirmation. Worktree is 工作树 now and workspace keeps 工作区 to
  itself. Also: Forget password means "clear the stored password", not password
  recovery; the SSH auth mode **Agent** was 代理, the same word as the proxy
  fields beside it; an SSH profile is a saved host (主机配置), not a file on
  disk; scrollback was 回滚, which means rollback — the opposite direction; and
  tty7's own server is now written `server`, the way `shell`, `pane` and `agent`
  already were, while 服务器 stays where it means the SSH host being connected
  to. (#334, #350, #417)

- **Kitty graphics frames cost one copy less** — a re-transmitting sender like
  terminal-browser sends a fresh full-window frame per rendered frame, ~26 MiB
  of RGBA at Retina resolution, and the client copied that buffer twice on the
  way to the atlas. The decode now consumes the frame `Vec` the reader already
  owns off the socket and drains the header off the front, and the uncompressed
  fast path moves the pixel buffer out so the R↔B swap happens in place. On a
  3216×2160 frame the decode-and-normalize step drops from ~1.78 ms to ~0.89 ms
  — about 53 ms/s at 60fps. (by @ayamir in #388)

- **Powerline separators are drawn with more curve segments**, so the
  half-circle caps read as circles at large font sizes.
  (by @cwatanab in #335, by @ArnoChenFx in #341)

- **macOS declares its privacy intents** — tty7 shipped no
  `NS*UsageDescription` keys, so macOS denied a pane's child process access to a
  protected folder (Containers, Mail, Messages, Calendar) with a repeated prompt
  instead of a single clear grant. The bundle now declares the folder, volume
  and device usage strings its peers declare, kitty-style, and the Full Disk
  Access manual grant is documented in the feature notes. No entitlement is
  added: the hardened-runtime automation check runs against the process actually
  sending an Apple event, which is the pane's child carrying its own signature,
  so granting one would only have widened what injected code could reach.
  (by @Gabyran in #323)

### Fixed

- **The ConPTY resize fix now actually engages** — the one-line opt-in that
  switches Windows panes onto conhost's resize model was lost from the
  working tree between verification and commit, and nothing caught it: the
  field defaults to off in the vendored `alacritty_terminal`, so the build,
  the test suite, and CI all stayed green while the previous nightly
  shipped with the semantics half of the fix disabled and the maximize
  garbling intact. The flag is back, and a regression test now pins the
  wiring itself so the flag can't silently drop again. (#419)

- **Maximizing a Windows pane no longer shreds it** — two separate resize
  disagreements stacked up here, and the visible one was the second.

  ConPTY emits no repaint after a resize; conhost silently re-anchors its
  own layout and keeps painting with absolute cursor addresses computed
  against it. Measured against a live ConPTY: growing the window keeps
  rows and cursor pinned and opens blank rows at the bottom — nothing is
  restored from scrollback — and shrinking scrolls the last *written* row
  (PSReadLine parks a continuation hint below the prompt) to the new
  bottom. The grid resized the alacritty way instead: growing pulled
  scrollback back into view and pushed the cursor down by that many rows.
  After a maximize the two layouts disagreed by exactly the pulled row
  count, so every later absolute-CUP paint — PSReadLine redraws the prompt
  that way per keystroke — landed mid-screen inside the old output. The
  vendored `alacritty_terminal` now has a `conpty_resize` mode that
  mirrors conhost's model for the primary screen (the alternate screen
  keeps stock behavior; its application repaints itself), and every pane
  on Windows opts in — a shell, `wsl.exe`, and `ssh.exe` are all presented
  through conhost alike. The cost is Windows-Terminal-standard behavior:
  maximizing no longer reveals extra scrollback below the fold.

  Separately, a resize during a burst of output reflowed the grid ahead of
  the backlog: the daemon can hold up to 16 MiB of queued old-width bytes,
  and the client parsed them into the already-resized grid. The daemon now
  echoes a `Size` frame to the controller at the exact stream position
  where the PTY changed geometry — the same geometry-tagging the reattach
  replay has always used — and the client defers its reflow to that
  marker, so every queued byte parses into the grid it was rendered for.
  Observers, which already received live `Size` frames but only applied
  them after a replay snapshot, follow the controller's resizes at the
  right moment too. The client keeps the reflow-at-request-time path
  against an older daemon that never echoes (new `resize-echo` feature
  probe), and on remote routes, where only the local daemon's features are
  known — a current remote daemon's echo lands there as a harmless
  same-size no-op, and probing per connection is the follow-up that
  extends deferral to remote panes. (#415)

- **The whole window no longer hangs after a remote workspace reconnects** — on
  Windows, `shutdown()` does not wake a thread parked in a blocking `read()` on
  the same socket the way it does on unix, and pane teardown shut the writer
  down and then *joined* the reader, counting on that wake-up. When the peer
  stayed silent — a routed pane whose SSH leg went zombie: nothing arrives, no
  FIN ever comes — the join blocked its caller, which was the UI thread. That is
  the "not responding" freeze right after a reconnect.

  Teardown now sets a per-reader quit flag and abandons the thread instead of
  joining it. The reader's read always times out within 500 ms so a parked
  reader notices the flag promptly, and it checks the flag once per frame, so a
  retired reader processes nothing at all — without that, a buffered `Exited`
  arriving down an abandoned link could close the pane that had just adopted its
  replacement. The reader teardown had no Windows test coverage at all before
  this; the new tests block for over three seconds against the old code. (#407)

- **A Windows update that reported success and left the old build** — the
  updater stopped the daemon and started the Inno installer the moment the
  daemon's endpoint disappeared, but the endpoint going away is not the same
  event as the images being released. The ConPTY hosts (`OpenConsole.exe`) are
  the daemon's children, not the shells', so the per-pane kill never reached
  them, and the daemon's `exit(0)` skipped every destructor that would have
  closed them: they kept the installed `OpenConsole.exe` open for seconds after
  `--stop-daemon` returned. Silent Setup then hit the lock, took the suppressed
  dialog's default (Abort), and the recovery relaunched the old build. A daemon
  that died without cleaning up made it permanent — its orphaned hosts survive
  indefinitely, which is the `DeleteFile` code 5 users hit even after "closing
  everything".

  Both shapes were reproduced in isolation first: with a pane open,
  `--stop-daemon` returned about a second in while `OpenConsole.exe` stayed
  locked for another 1.4 s; after killing the daemon outright, the orphaned host
  held the lock forever. The shutdown now finishes what it starts at every layer
  that can be the last one standing — the daemon reaps its descendants and waits
  for them while the endpoint is still up, `stop()` waits for the recorded pid to
  actually exit rather than merely stop listening, and
  `--stop-daemon --update-install-dir` also terminates anything still running
  from the installation directory and only returns once the `.exe`/`.dll` images
  there open for writing, naming the holdouts if they never do. The updater runs
  that clearing itself before invoking Setup, so a directory that cannot be
  cleared fails with a cause in `update.log` instead of Inno's bare
  "DeleteFile failed; code 5".

  Three smaller holes closed with it: the macOS updater waits for its parent by
  watching `getppid()` reparent to launchd rather than polling `kill(pid, 0)`,
  which a recycled pid could satisfy forever; a Windows update guard makes
  `ensure_running` refuse to spawn a daemon mid-install, so a `tty7` CLI call
  cannot relock the images Setup is replacing; and a Windows portable backup
  carries an incomplete marker from the first file move until the replacement
  lands, so an interrupted update is reported at the next launch instead of
  leaving a silently mixed installation. (#403)

- **A newly installed command works in the next pane** — Windows hands every
  process a private copy of the environment block at `CreateProcess` time and
  never updates it, so a daemon that had been up since before an installer
  edited `HKCU\Environment` gave a brand-new pane its startup `PATH` and the
  freshly installed command was unresolvable until tty7 restarted. Windows
  Terminal launched from Explorer found it, because Explorer rebuilds its own
  block when it sees `WM_SETTINGCHANGE`.

  Rather than chase broadcast messages, the daemon re-reads the two hives
  Windows itself composes an environment from — machine
  `Session Manager\Environment` and `HKCU\Environment` — at the moment a pane is
  spawned. The merge is a pure function over (machine, user, process, configured
  overrides), so the semantics are unit-testable without a registry: names are
  keyed case-insensitively so `Path` and `PATH` collapse into one variable;
  `PATH` and `PSModulePath` are *combined*, machine first, which is what Windows
  does and what keeps a per-user install from shadowing the system half;
  `REG_EXPAND_SZ` values are expanded against the merged map with a depth bound;
  the machine hive's `USERNAME=SYSTEM` is dropped as Windows drops it; and
  directories the daemon's own `PATH` held that neither hive lists stay
  reachable, appended behind the registry entries — freshening `PATH` should
  only ever add resolvable commands. (#349, reported by @yhzhu99 in #333)

- **Windows panes can answer a background-color query** — the in-box conhost
  swallows a pane process's OSC 11 query, so it never reached tty7's emulator
  and no reply was written back: applications that pick a light or dark UI from
  the terminal background rendered a dark UI under a light theme. tty7 already
  answers OSC 10/11/12 from the live theme, so nothing was missing but a
  pseudoconsole that forwards the question. Microsoft ships one as a
  redistributable and `portable-pty` already prefers a sideloaded `conpty.dll`
  over kernel32's, so this is packaging rather than code: the pair goes beside
  `tty7-app.exe`.

  Measured on Windows 11 26200, same binary, only the pair added beside it: with
  the in-box host the client times out with no reply; with the bundled ConPTY a
  real pane reads back `rgb:efef/f1f1/f5f5` under `catppuccin_latte`, which is
  that preset's exact background. The two files are one supported unit, so the
  release verifier fails a package carrying only one, a mismatched pair, or a
  DLL without its MIT notice, and `build.rs` stages them beside cargo's output
  so a development build does not quietly run on the in-box host.
  (#360, reported by @yhzhu99 in #345)

- **A second cursor no longer blinks in the wrong place on Windows** —
  conhost's VT renderer brackets every frame it paints with `?25l` … `?25h` so
  the cursor does not flicker across the repaint, and it moves the cursor
  explicitly just before the show only on the frames where it painted the
  cursor. On the others the show commits wherever the last erase or write left
  it, and the cursor blinks there until conhost's next frame moves it back. tty7
  repaints when a batch of pty output lands, so it draws that cursor for a frame
  — and a TUI that repaints on a spinner produces one every tick.

  Measured on Windows 11 26200 from a raw ConPTY capture of a Codex session at
  110×30: 295 ms of cursor-visible dwell across 42 frames parked at the end of
  the status line, each stray corrected 7–15 ms later by the following frame.
  A scanner now pairs each hide with its show and marks the show as *parked*
  when the run in between moved the cursor around to paint but did not end on a
  move — nothing chose the cell it is about to appear on — and restores the cell
  the cursor stood on when it went invisible, which is where the correcting
  frame would have put it anyway. A hide and a show more than 100 ms apart are
  an application keeping the cursor off for the length of some work, not a
  renderer bracketing one frame, and are left alone. This is inert where the
  bundled ConPTY redistributable is in play; it earns its keep on hosts without
  it, notably a remote Windows server. (#362)

- **Windows toasts are tty7's, not PowerShell's** — notifications showed the
  PowerShell icon and name because tty7 had no AUMID of its own registered. It
  now brands the process and refreshes the single per-user `tty7.lnk` Inno's
  default install owns — but only when that shortcut is not already ours, never
  from a cargo build directory, and never as a second per-user copy beside an
  all-users install, all three of which the first cut got wrong on a real
  machine. The shell indexes a new `.lnk` asynchronously and `Toast::show()`
  reports success while dropping the toast for an AUMID it has not seen yet, so
  toasts keep the PowerShell identity for half a minute after tty7 writes one:
  ugly beats invisible. (by @shihuaidexianyu in #340, reported in #339)

- **Windows panes are told whether the window is light or dark** — the daemon
  needs to know when it spawns a pane, because ConPTY drops the child's OSC 11
  query before tty7's emulator can answer it. It was reading that from a dead
  `Config::theme` field, which meant the GUI had to rewrite the user's
  `config.json` every time the effective preset changed sides. The hint moves to
  its own `appearance.json` in the data dir: derived state, written by the
  process that paints the window and read by the one that has to describe it.
  Absent, unreadable and unparsable all read as light — what the default preset
  is — so a daemon that starts before the GUI has ever applied a theme describes
  the default window instead of guessing. (by @yhzhu99 in #332)

- **Scoop shims work again when tty7 is launched from a hardened Windows
  shell broker** — some brokers enforce `ProcessRedirectionTrustPolicy` on
  what they start. The daemon inherited it, every ConPTY shell under the
  daemon inherited it in turn, and PowerShell could then no longer traverse
  a user-created junction — which is exactly what Scoop's `current` links
  are. `oh-my-posh` and `fzf` died with `Shim: Could not determine if target
  is a GUI app`. Windows Terminal was unaffected because its process tree
  never picked the policy up in the first place.

  The policy cannot be relaxed once it is on, so the fix is to not inherit
  it: when tty7 detects the enforcing bit, it creates the daemon with
  `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS` naming the interactive desktop
  shell, which supplies the ordinary desktop token, device map, and
  mitigation policy. Everything else about the spawn is unchanged, and the
  ordinary path still runs whenever the policy is absent — or whenever the
  desktop shell cannot be borrowed, in which case tty7 logs a warning and
  starts degraded rather than not starting at all. Note the daemon's token on
  the clean-parent path derives from Explorer, so an elevated tty7 starts a
  medium-integrity daemon. (by @ArnoChenFx in #292)

- **A pane's last line of output no longer loses the race with its exit on
  Windows** — the process-exit monitor could observe a short-lived shell
  exiting before the ConPTY reader had delivered its final frame, so
  `Exited` reached clients ahead of the output that preceded it. The
  monitor now releases the pseudoconsole and lets the reader, which reports
  only after it has forwarded everything up to EOF, announce the death. A
  bounded window behind it still covers the case where EOF never arrives —
  a grandchild holding the ConPTY output pipe open keeps the shell's own
  exit from ever closing it. (by @ArnoChenFx in #292)

- **A resumed agent keeps the flags it was launched with, on Windows** — on
  macOS and Linux the daemon reads the foreground process's real argv, so
  `resume_command` can replay a launch flag like
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. The Windows path detects the agent from the
  OSC 133;C command capture but threw the command line away, stamping an empty
  argv, so every resumed agent came back bare. The captured command is now
  tokenized (case preserved, quotes trimmed, the PowerShell call operator
  dropped) and stamped as the pane's launch argv; fork commands share that
  source and are fixed by the same change. (#406)

- **Codex hook commands work under PowerShell on Windows** — the installed hook
  command is written as a PATH-resolvable bare name rather than a path
  PowerShell would not run. (by @shihuaidexianyu in #298)

- **Switching workspaces no longer destroys live sessions** — it rebuilt every
  pane it was asked to restore, and a window that rebuilt nothing then deleted
  the workspace outright, tree and store both. Three separate guesses, each one
  authorizing an irreversible act.

  `session_from_tree` erased a pane's id when the tree said `live: false`. That
  flag is a cached observation from another process, reloaded as false on every
  server start, so a quiet pane read as dead while its shell was running: the
  restore had nothing to attach to and spawned a fresh shell over it. Two
  servers could also start against one config dir — `run_with` decided another
  server was dead by failing to connect once, then unlinked its socket and bound
  its own, and the loser kept `control.sock` with an empty pane registry, so
  `MachineGet` reported every pane dead and nothing logged an error. And
  `finish_hydration` marked a window informed before the rebuild and without
  looking at the result, while `tabs_from_session` drops any tab whose panes all
  fail to start — which is every tab when the pane socket is unreachable —
  leaving a window that was empty and authoritative at once, so the next switch
  deleted a workspace with ten live tabs.

  Each is now settled by whoever holds the truth: attaching decides whether a
  pane is there, an advisory lock decides which process is the server, and a
  deletion needs the machine's own mirror to agree that the workspace is empty.
  A corrupt `views.json` is quarantined the way `machine.json` already was,
  rather than logged and overwritten by the next save. (#410)

- **Tab in a WSL pane completes paths again** — the pane's filesystem is
  foreign, so the completion engine had no cwd to list and handed every Tab back
  to bash. A WSL pane's POSIX cwd (OSC 7) is now translated to the distro's
  `\\wsl$` share, which this process can read like any directory, while
  everything that would consult *this* machine stays switched off: no `PATH`
  binaries in the command position, no generator scripts, and `~` is left to the
  shell, since it names the distro's home. Absolute words stay inside the share,
  so `ls /etc<Tab>` lists the distro's `/etc` and not `C:\etc`. A `wsl.exe` pane
  spawned without `--distribution` resolves the default distro from the registry
  rather than carrying an empty placeholder.

  The follow-up fixed the gate that had made this unreachable for the case it
  was written for: a pane in a WSL *workspace* is served by the daemon inside
  the distro, so its host id is never `LOCAL`, and an early locality check threw
  those panes away. The check belongs only to the `wsl.exe`-in-a-local-workspace
  branch — a remote host's WSL pane must not read a same-named share here —
  while a WSL workspace is this computer's distro by construction. (#408, #418)

- **A WSL machine can restart and replace its server** — the machine menu
  offered "restart server" only when the target was SSH, so a distro's row had
  just "new workspace" and "disconnect", and the router refused the action for
  anything else even though `restart_wsl_daemon` had been sitting unused since it
  was written. A distro's server is installed and launched from this computer
  exactly like an SSH one; only the transport differs. Both actions now have WSL
  arms, so the mismatch dialog's **Update Server** is no longer a dead end
  there. A `--stdio` workspace still has nothing to restart: it is whatever
  program the user named. (#417)

- **The mismatch dialog replaces the server binary instead of just restarting
  it** — the old **Restart Server** button restarted the same incompatible
  daemon, leaving the user on the same mismatch afterwards. It now replaces the
  binary and then restarts, and says so: **Update Server**.
  (by @shihuaidexianyu in #352, reported in #351)

- **A version-mismatched remote server is described as old, not as
  not-tty7** — a handshake refused on the control dialect was shown with the
  protocol layer's own wording: "java answered, but not as a tty7 server:
  control peer (build …) speaks control v4, this build speaks v5". The far end
  *is* tty7; it is a build on the other side of a dialect bump, and the reader
  cannot act on the dialect numbers either way. The message now states which
  side is behind, and the button names the action. The failure that followed was
  also invisible: the switcher paints a failed `connect` in preference to stored
  host errors, and restarting or replacing a server cleared only the latter, so
  whatever went wrong during the install was covered by the complaint that
  started it. (#384)

- **Remote server errors appear under the machine they came from** — restart and
  replace failures were reported through a global modal, which mixed errors from
  different machines together and blocked the UI. They are now stored per host
  and surfaced in that host's switcher group, which expands to show them, with a
  Dismiss button scoped to its own host and a clear on the next connect so a
  later success does not leave a stale failure on screen. A failure raised where
  there is no switcher to put it in — the window menu's restart command, or a
  mismatch hit mid-connect — still falls back to the modal.
  (by @shihuaidexianyu in #354)

- **An SSH remote install uses the bundled server before reaching for the
  network** — it only ever checked the release download path and ignored the
  server binary already shipped beside the Windows executable, which WSL was
  using. The bundled binary is now auto-discovered and the GitHub release
  download is the fallback for when no matching local asset exists. The explicit
  path keeps its strict no-fallback behavior, and WSL remains bundled-only.
  (by @shihuaidexianyu in #344)

- **A server that is only a control dialect behind is noticed at launch** — the
  pane protocol and the control dialect are versioned apart and the launch check
  only compared the first, so a server from before the v4-to-v5 control bump
  answered the pane handshake with this build's own number and was waved through
  as ours while every machine-tree call was refused: the window opened with no
  tabs and the only trace was a log line the default config does not write
  anywhere. The control socket is asked too now, and the restart prompt says
  which version disagrees and picks its wording by which side is ahead, rather
  than calling a newer server old. A window that still opens empty says why —
  once per window, latched, since a failed pull is retried from every
  fifteen-second sync. (#387)

- **"Keep Shells" is no longer offered beside a mismatched server** — both
  handshakes compare their version for equality and hang up on anything else, so
  a server whose number disagrees cannot be talked round, and that button
  offered a state that does not work: panes still spawn while every machine-tree
  call is refused, which is how a window opens with no tabs and saves none of
  the ones you make. The choice is now restart or quit. Quit goes first, because
  it destroys nothing — the server and every shell under it keep running — and
  because this prompt arrives unasked at launch, the moment a stray Return is
  likeliest. A prompt dismissed without an answer re-arms instead of falling
  through. (#389)

- **Pasting a screenshot into a remote pane works** — the clipboard-image paste
  that stages a file and hands the agent its path was built off macOS only,
  because a local macOS agent reads the system clipboard itself when it sees
  Ctrl+V and that carries the image at full fidelity. The reasoning stops at the
  pane boundary: an agent in an SSH pane or a remote workspace reads the
  clipboard of the host *it* runs on, which never holds this machine's
  screenshot, so the paste did nothing at all. Remote panes now stage and upload
  on every platform, while a local macOS pane keeps its direct path untouched.
  macOS screenshots arrive as TIFF, which agent vision rejects the same way it
  rejects a Windows BMP, so those transcode to PNG on the way out.

  Staging is hardened on the remote side. `/tmp/tty7-clipboard-<user>` is a
  predictable name in a world-writable directory: any local account on the
  remote host could pre-create it, and the `Mkdir` result was discarded, so tty7
  would have uploaded into a directory someone else owned — readable by them,
  and swappable for another image before the pane's agent opened the path.
  Images now stage in `$HOME/.cache/tty7/clipboard` resolved from the session's
  own `realpath .`, and the directory is verified before anything goes into it:
  a symlink is refused outright, a `chmod 0700` the daemon watched succeed is
  the ownership proof, and a following `stat` must report exactly `0700`. Any
  doubt is a hard failure that falls back to pasting the local path. The whole
  path also moves off the UI thread, which is what lets a failed upload notify
  once, naming the host and the reason, instead of leaving a dangling remote
  path in the line and saying nothing.
  (by @shihuaidexianyu in #338, reported in #337; #399)

- **A WSL pane is handed a path it can actually open** — the same paste staged
  its file on the Windows side and pasted the Windows name for it, so an agent in
  WSL got `C:\Users\…\paste-1.png` and found nothing there. A WSL pane shares
  this machine's disk but not its path syntax, so there is nothing to upload and
  only a name to rewrite: the paste now carries the automount view,
  `/mnt/c/Users/…`. A path with no mapping — a UNC temp directory — keeps the
  Windows name, which at least says where the file went. (#399)

- **Arrow keys reach ncurses applications in the form they asked for** — Arrow,
  Home and End were always sent as their CSI form, no matter what the foreground
  program had requested. Programs that turn on DECCKM via `smkx` — which is
  every ncurses full-screen app — expect the SS3 form, because that is what
  `xterm-256color` spells `kcuu1` and friends as, and ncurses matches terminfo
  byte for byte. htop was the report: ncurses failed to match `\E[A`, handed the
  bytes to htop one at a time, and htop binds `[` to "lower priority", so every
  Up or Down bumped the selected process's nice value instead of moving the
  selection. The same breakage hit ncdu, mc, dialog, menuconfig and nmtui;
  shells were unaffected because readline and zle bind both forms.

  Named keys now also carry their modifiers the way terminfo declares them
  (`kLFT=\E[1;2D`, `kUP5=\E[1;5A`, `kDC3=\E[3;3~`) instead of dropping
  Shift/Ctrl entirely and prefixing Alt with a bare ESC. Cmd stays out of the
  modifier parameter — xterm has no encoding for it.
  (#366, reported by @hak0 in #361)

- **A right-click goes to the application when mouse reporting is on** — a TUI
  that turns mouse reporting on (vim with `set mouse=a`, lazygit, tmux) draws its
  own right-button menus, and tty7 was delivering one right-click to both
  consumers: the press was forwarded to the application *and* tty7's own context
  menu popped over the top of it. One pure predicate now decides, called from
  both sides, so one click can only ever feed one consumer; Shift stays the
  escape hatch that reaches tty7, the same override it already provides for
  selection and for the wheel. (#347)

- **`$SHELL` names the shell the pane actually runs** — a pane configured to run
  fish still advertised the login shell, because the pane environment injected
  `TERM`, the `TTY7_*` markers and `TERM_PROGRAM` but never touched `SHELL`, so
  the pane inherited the GUI session's login-time snapshot. Everything that
  spawns "the user's shell" read that: tmux's `default-shell` started zsh inside
  a fish pane, and so did `sudo -s`, an editor's shell escape, and any coding
  agent picking a quoting dialect from `$SHELL`. The failure is silent — fish
  rejects the bash line, the agent's sentinel file never appears, and the
  rejected text stays in the line editor to concatenate onto the next send.

  `SHELL` is now injected alongside the other markers, set to the absolute path
  of the program the pane is about to exec, read off argv rather than off the
  shell tty7 resolved — an argv-replacing integration injection and the
  parent-shell override both rewrite argv. Only an absolute path is ever
  written: a configured command may be bare so `PATH` decides which install
  wins, so a bare name is resolved against the `PATH` the pane will inherit and
  skipped when that finds nothing. An explicit `SHELL` in the user's env block
  still wins. Windows is deliberately left out — neither cmd nor PowerShell reads
  `SHELL`, and the POSIX emulations that do want a POSIX path.
  (#348, reported by @nohzafk in #342)

- **The login shell is read from passwd, not from a stale `$SHELL`** — `$SHELL`
  is a snapshot the session inherits at login, so `chsh` never moves it: a GUI
  launch kept reporting the shell that was current when the user logged in, and
  the window's shell menu marked the wrong entry "default" for that whole
  stretch. The passwd entry is read instead, via the reentrant `getpwuid_r`,
  with `$SHELL` as the fallback. The same change fixes who wins a name in the
  menu: `$PATH` is probed before `/etc/shells`, so on a machine with a Homebrew
  bash the menu's "bash" is the binary typing `bash` would reach rather than
  macOS's 3.2 from 2007. (#278)

- **A forwarding `.bash_profile` no longer sources `.bashrc` twice** — the
  rcfile tty7 hands bash replays the login-shell startup chain, but then sourced
  `~/.bashrc` unconditionally afterwards. A login shell never does that on its
  own: `~/.bashrc` arrives only because the profile that won the chain forwarded
  to it, which is how nearly every `~/.bash_profile` is written. The result was
  the user's whole `~/.bashrc` running twice per pane — banners printed twice,
  completions sourced twice, appends to `PROMPT_COMMAND` stacking up.
  `~/.bashrc` joins the same first-match-wins chain, which keeps the fallback
  for a `$HOME` with no profile at all. (#279)

- **The macOS locale fallback sets `LANG`, not `LC_CTYPE`** — when a pane
  inherits no locale at all, the usual case for a GUI-launched process on macOS,
  tty7 derives an installed UTF-8 locale and injects it — but as `LC_CTYPE`,
  which backs only character handling. Collation, time and numbers stayed at C,
  and bash warned `setlocale: LC_COLLATE: cannot change locale ()` once per
  category on every launch; zsh and fish swallowed the failure and merely looked
  fine while being just as half-configured. `LANG` backs every category and
  still loses to any `LC_*` the user's own rc files set afterwards, which is
  what a fallback should do. (#280)

- **Three defects in the inline completion menu** — a candidate was inserted
  verbatim, so a directory named `My Documents` completed to `cd My Documents/`,
  which the shell resplits into two arguments; candidates are escaped now, with
  a leading `~/` left alone since that prefix is the user's own text and escaping
  it would stop the home expansion it was typed for. The same escape decides
  whether a common-prefix step is safe to write — the prefix shared by
  `My Documents` and `My Music` is `My `, and writing it raw both broke the line
  and closed the menu on the next keystroke — so a prefix that needs escaping
  steps through the candidates instead. A menu fed only by generators stayed
  armed forever when nothing matched, swallowing every later Tab instead of
  handing the line to the shell; sessions now count their generators and the
  last one to answer closes a menu that still has nothing in it. And command
  completion scanned *this* machine's `PATH` in a remote pane, so
  `system_prof<Tab>` over SSH to Linux offered macOS's `system_profiler` —
  builtins are true on any POSIX shell and still go out, the `PATH` scan is now
  local-only. (#276)

- **macOS editing shortcuts reach a foreground TUI** — Cmd+Backspace and the
  rest of the line-editing chord set are forwarded to the application instead of
  being swallowed. (by @loscoy in #304)

- **Ctrl-E accepts a ghost suggestion on the first try** — it accepts a visible
  inline history suggestion while keeping end-of-line behavior when none is
  shown. (by @vkingw in #329, reported in #315)

- **No stray `^U` after interrupting an agent** — typeahead captured across an
  alt-screen boundary was replayed into the line editor after the interrupt.
  (by @shihuaidexianyu in #312, reported by @fuchen in #305)

- **The editor is restored after an interrupted tab handoff.** (#290)

- **ANSI dim text and text decorations render** — underline, double underline,
  curly, dotted, dashed, overline and strikethrough, and SGR 2 dim.
  (#288, #289)

- **Powerline separators have no seam between them** — adjacent separators left
  a hairline of background between the two glyphs. A cover quad closes it, and
  is skipped when the glyph is dim: the cover and the anti-aliased path overlap
  on the closing edge's device pixel, which is a no-op for an opaque foreground
  but pushes a dim cell's alpha to 0.884 and tints the neighboring cell's
  background. (by @ArnoChenFx in #336)

- **Tokens that bypassed the contrast machinery now have a floor** — sidebar
  text, the caret and hairlines were flat blends with no floor, sitting one line
  away from tokens that are bisected to hit a target exactly, and semantic inks
  were floored against the window background but painted on popovers and sidebar
  rows, which sit a step toward the foreground. `sidebar_fg` is floored at 4.5:1
  on the sidebar fill it is actually painted on — four builtins landed at
  3.35–3.92:1 — the caret is conditioned to 3:1, where the default Light theme
  shipped an orange caret on pure white at 2.07:1, `border` keeps its blend but
  gains a 1.5:1 floor so a divider is worth the same in every theme, and
  semantic inks clear their floor on background, sidebar and popover alike.
  Themes that already cleared a floor are untouched. (#400)

- **Smooth scroll steps are aligned with presented frames**, and a queued scroll
  animation wakes the window. (by @ArnoChenFx in #414)

- **Kitty graphics frames cannot pile up faster than they decode** — the
  unbounded decode channel becomes a bounded latest-frame inbox, so a
  full-window sender cannot queue frames faster than they are consumed, and
  superseded frames are discarded before being decoded. Only images that reached
  the sprite atlas are retired, and remaining atlas entries are evicted when a
  pane closes, which keeps hidden terminal-browser tabs and repeated pane
  lifecycles from retaining one decoded frame per repaint.

- **The terminal's own context menu and search bar are translated** — the
  context menu was the last surface still speaking hardcoded English in a
  three-locale app, 14 literals of it, and the search bar had three more with
  its Previous / Next / Close buttons icon-only and untooltipped. It also spoke
  a fourth vocabulary for one action: "Maximize Pane" for what the menu bar, the
  palette and Keybindings all call "Zoom Pane", and "Close Pane" for what is
  "Close Pane / Tab" everywhere else — which is the accurate name, since the
  action closes the tab when the pane is the last one. (#401)

- **A new tab lands in its repo group on the first frame** instead of appearing
  ungrouped for one paint. (by @ArnoChenFx in #411)

- **Settings hover highlights respond immediately**, with a stable row identity
  so the highlight does not jump between rows. (by @ArnoChenFx in #313)

- **Overlay scrollbars are softer.** (#293)

- **`tty7 send` submits its Enter outside a paste burst**, so an agent does not
  read the newline as part of pasted text. (#322)

- **Closing a tab from the CLI terminates its panes.** (#319)

- **`tty7` diagnoses an unavailable agent hook** instead of failing silently.
  (#321)

- **tty7 no longer panics on launch under Wayland on a slow VM** — the
  xdg-desktop-portal event source notified windows of the initial color-scheme
  and button-layout replies while still holding `client.borrow_mut()`, and those
  callbacks re-enter GPUI and reach the same `RefCell`. Whether it fires depends
  on whether the portal reply beats window creation, so a VMware Ubuntu guest
  lost that race every time. Fixed in the gpui fork for both the Wayland and X11
  clients by collecting the window pointers and dropping the borrow before
  notifying.

- **The Windows package verifier can read the Inno payload again** — the bundle
  script deleted the staging directory as its last act, and the verifier reads
  that directory to check what lands in `{app}`, since a compiled `setup.exe`
  cannot be read back without innoextract. Every Windows build had failed the
  check since it arrived, taking nightly red for two nights, and a stable
  release would have failed the same way. Both workflows already expected the
  directory to survive — their upload steps name it among the intermediates the
  asset globs deliberately skip — so the removal goes rather than the check.
  (#368)

## [26.8.1] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- **A remote workspace is a window that is one machine, not a pane that
  happens to be SSH'd somewhere** — pick a host from **Home → Connect to
  Host** (or the workspace switcher) and tty7 opens a window bound to that
  machine: its own tab and pane tree, file browser and editor, repo grouping,
  branch line, Changes panel, diff overlay and worktree list, all answered by
  *that* machine rather than read off the client's disk. Before this, reaching
  a remote box meant an SSH pane from the command palette — a shell and
  nothing else. Repo grouping, the diff overlay, the right-panel Changes list,
  worktrees: all of it read the client's local disk, so none of it existed
  over SSH. The file tree was SFTP browsing, a separate, lesser thing from the
  local editor. And the moment you closed the lid or lost the network, the
  agent running in that pane died with the connection — there was nothing on
  the far side to keep it alive.

  A remote workspace fixes all four at once by putting the same code on both
  ends. `tty7-server` — a new headless binary built on `tty7-core`, the crate
  the GUI's own daemon logic was extracted into — runs on the far machine and
  serves the identical `LocalHost` implementation the GUI uses for your own
  disk, over one control connection. Because both sides run the *same* code
  rather than a client-only reimplementation, a remote workspace has the exact
  feature set a local one does, not a cut-down version of it. Sessions live in
  that server, not in the window: closing the window detaches rather than
  kills, panes and agent conversations keep running on the far side, and
  reconnecting — from this laptop or another one — lands back where you left
  it.

  Local and remote workspaces are two different features, not one with a flag:
  a window is never a mix of an SSH pane and a real workspace, and that split
  is enforced rather than left to convention. The install itself is one-time
  and unprivileged — the server is a static binary pushed over the same
  connection, no `sudo`, confirmed once per machine. This is the foundation
  the WSL-machines, incremental git-streaming and per-machine `⌃R` history
  entries below build on: none of them had anywhere to attach to before this
  landed. (#235)

- **`tty7` is now a CLI, not just the app you launch by clicking an icon** —
  a new scriptable command-line client, built for coding agents to drive
  panes without a window in the way. The GUI binary is renamed `tty7-app`
  (bundle id, icons and display name unchanged); `tty7`, the name you type,
  is now the CLI. Both are clients of the same `tty7-server` a remote
  workspace runs, talking the same control and pane protocols the window
  does — an agent reaching through the CLI can do exactly what the CLI
  exposes, no more, no less.

  | | |
  |---|---|
  | Hot path | `ls`, `run -- <cmd>` (real exit code, `--keep` keeps the pane around), `new`, `send`, `capture`, `split`, `procs` |
  | Addressing | `ws` / `tab` (`@N`) / `pane` (`%N`) / `machine` / `server` |
  | Introspection | `agents`, `events` (NDJSON), `status`, `doctor` |
  | Global | `-m <machine>` routes over the server's existing SSH/WSL links; `--json` everywhere; implicit context from `TTY7_PANE` / `TTY7_WS` / `TTY7_SOCKET`, injected into every spawned shell |

  The server's control dialect grew several additive verbs to carry this: a
  read-only `Observe` for watching a pane without owning it, budgeted per
  observer; pane exit codes, which previously were always reported `None`
  and now actually carry the code; and aggregate `AgentStates` / `Routes` /
  `Status` queries. Writing into a pane now hands off cleanly instead of
  fighting the previous controller for it — a displaced client gets a clean
  EOF and its stale input is dropped, closing a long-standing hazard where
  two writers on one pane could leave it looking frozen. `tty7_core::client`
  exposes the `ControlClient`/`PaneClient` pair the CLI is built on as a
  public library, with zero behavior change to the GUI's own connection code.

  There is deliberately no interactive `attach` verb — agents drive panes
  with `run` / `send` / `capture` / `events` instead of taking one over
  interactively. An `attach` verb was designed and partway built during this
  work and then dropped before it ever reached a release, so this is design
  history, not a behavior change for anyone — the CLI itself is new in this
  release, so there was no previous `tty7 attach` to remove out from under
  existing scripts. The protocol-level `Attach` call the GUI's own panes use
  is untouched.

  Every unimplemented verb (`ws stop`, `machine connect`/`disconnect`, bare
  `tty7` launching the GUI) says so in `--help` rather than only failing at
  runtime. Along the way, the GUI's own copy was reworded for the same two
  concepts the CLI now names — "server" for the background process, "shell"
  for what runs in a pane — replacing inconsistent uses of "daemon" and
  "session" in the tray, palette and confirmation dialogs (no behavior
  change, wording only). (#274)

- **The CLI ships in every install and lands on PATH automatically** —
  previously it was built by every release and then discarded: the bundle
  scripts copied only `tty7-app`, and the upload glob never reached the CLI
  binary. It now ships inside the macOS `.app`, the Linux tarball and
  AppImage, and the Windows installer and zip, and a fresh launch puts it
  where a shell can find it without you doing anything.

  The install is split into two halves on purpose. The **environment half**
  prepends the CLI's directory to the GUI process's own PATH before the
  server is spawned, so every pane — which inherits its environment from the
  server, which inherits it from the GUI — can run `tty7` immediately. It
  writes nothing to disk and cannot fail. The **on-disk half** covers typing
  `tty7` in some other terminal, and is allowed to fail safely: on Unix it
  symlinks into a fixed, ordered list of candidate directories
  (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `~/bin`,
  `~/.cargo/bin`) rather than scanning PATH for the first writable entry —
  version-manager shim directories (pyenv, rbenv, asdf, mise) sit at the
  front of many people's PATH and are writable, and a binary dropped there
  survives only until that tool next rehashes and silently deletes it. On
  Windows it appends the app's directory to `HKCU\Environment` through the
  registry API rather than `setx`, which truncates and corrupts anything
  over 1024 characters, and reads/writes the value as UTF-16 end to end so a
  PATH entry Rust can't represent as a `String` survives untouched.

  It is deliberately conservative about what it touches: only a symlink (or,
  on the AppImage, a copy) this installer itself created is ever replaced —
  marked as ours with a small marker file so a user who moves from the
  AppImage to the tarball still gets recognized and re-linked rather than
  mistaken for someone else's binary — and a real file or a symlink aimed
  elsewhere is left alone. An occupied candidate directory doesn't end the
  scan, and every platform now reports whether the install actually wins the
  lookup (`InstalledShadowed` names whichever `tty7` beats it on PATH).
  Debug builds and cargo build trees only get the environment half, so a
  `cargo run` can't repoint your real `tty7` at a binary the next `cargo
  clean` deletes. The Windows uninstaller removes the PATH entry it added;
  on Unix there is no uninstall hook, so the symlink is left dangling and
  that limitation is stated in the module docs rather than left to be
  discovered. The whole thing turns off from Settings → About, or
  `install_cli_on_path: false` in `config.json`. (#277)

- **Pi is a first-class agent, not a fallback one** — Pi panes drew the generic
  robot glyph every unbranded agent shares, so a Pi tab was indistinguishable
  from an Aider or Qwen one in the sidebar, the tab chip and the tray menu. They
  now carry their own avatar on the existing sky accent, status dot unchanged.
  The mark is Pi's own, from pi.dev, rescaled to tty7's 24x24 icon grid — its
  `prefers-color-scheme` stylesheet dropped, since these avatars are tinted by
  the app. Restoring a Pi pane also resumes its conversation now: the tty7
  extension reports Pi's session id, and the resume command is
  `pi --session <id>` (Pi's `--resume` is a boolean that only opens the
  interactive picker), with `--session` / `--session-id` / `--fork` /
  `--resume` / `-r` / `--continue` / `-c` stripped off the replayed launch
  flags so the restored id wins. A pane launched with `--no-session` is not
  resumed at all — that pane never wrote a session to disk, and reopening one
  would override the choice to keep it ephemeral. (#240)

- **Fork an agent session** — branch a live agent conversation into a second,
  independent one, so a risky direction can be tried without losing the thread
  that got you there. tty7 shells the agent's *own* fork command rather than
  touching its transcript files: `codex fork <id>`, `claude --resume <id>
  --fork-session`, `opencode --session <id> --fork`, `grok --resume <id>
  --fork-session` — every one checked against the installed CLI's own help.
  Agents with no fork tty7 could verify simply don't offer the action, rather
  than getting a row that can only produce a usage error. The command carries
  the pane's original launch flags exactly as session restore does, and sheds
  the stale session-targeting ones so a fork of a fork can't branch twice or
  replay an old id as a prompt.

  Where the fork lands follows where you asked from: right-click a **pane** and
  it asks for a split placement (Right / Left / Down / Up), since a pane-level
  ask is a spatial one; right-click a **tab** or a sidebar row and it opens in a
  new tab, with no placement question. The command palette and the File menu
  carry the new-tab form only — a placement question means nothing when the ask
  wasn't a spatial one — while all five, the four directions included, are
  bindable in Settings → Keybindings.

  A fork needs the session id the agent's hooks report, so the row disables
  itself — rather than disappearing — until one arrives, and a remote pane can't
  fork at all (the command would run against the *local* agent). Forking while a
  turn is in flight is allowed but says so: agents fork from the persisted
  transcript, so the turn you're watching won't be in the copy. The parent is
  never modified either way. (#241)

- **Your WSL distributions are machines you can open a workspace on** — the
  transport for them has been there since remote workspaces landed
  (`wsl.exe -d <distro> -- tty7-server --stdio`: no SSH, no address, no
  credential, no host key), but nothing offered one, so nothing could reach it.
  Every installed distribution now appears in the workspace switcher beside your
  saved SSH hosts, and opening one is the whole setup — there is nothing to
  configure, because there is nothing that *could* be configured. The row is
  named exactly what `wsl -d` calls the distro, since that string is also how
  the machine is keyed (`wsl:<distro>`), and searching the switcher for `wsl`
  finds all of them.

  A distribution is served the Linux `tty7-server` this client shipped with
  rather than one downloaded from a release, so the first connect writes it into
  `~/.local/share/tty7/bin` inside the distro — with the same one-time
  confirmation any other machine gets, and no `sudo` anywhere. A build with no
  bundled server (any `cargo build`, and any platform that isn't Windows) says
  so and names the directories it looked in.

  Two things had to be fixed for this to work at all, both invisible until
  something could actually select a distribution. WSL kills what an interop
  session started the moment its `wsl.exe` exits, and `setsid` does not make the
  new daemon safe instantly — so the launch now holds its invocation open until
  the daemon answers, instead of reporting "started but nothing was answering on
  the control socket" over a correctly installed binary. And a pane's connection now asks
  for the remote's *pane* socket: the flag that says so was added by the SSH
  path and by the local `--stdio` one, but never by WSL, so the workspace would
  connect and the window would open with a pane that could not reach the machine.

  Ports need no forwarding (WSL shares `localhost`, so ⌘-clicking a dev server's
  URL just works), and files move over the same `Host` calls every remote
  workspace uses, or through `\\wsl$` directly. (#253)

- **Copy Session ID** — the agent's native session id on the clipboard, beside
  *Copy Working Directory* in the tab / sidebar context menu, the palette and
  the File menu. Codex has no copy-or-duplicate subcommand — forking *is* how
  you duplicate a conversation there — so copying the id is what "copy the
  session" means: paste it into `codex resume`, a bug report, or another tool.
  (#241)

- **Remote panes read big git output incrementally** — `Host` grew a streaming
  companion to its buffered `git`, implemented on both the local host and the
  remote wire protocol, so a read whose size scales with the work tree no
  longer has to exist in memory all at once on either side. The buffered call
  stays for the many reads that answer in bytes. A stream that goes silent for
  two minutes while the link stays up ends with a timeout rather than parking
  its reader forever — the wait is between chunks, not on the whole read, so a
  slow-but-alive `git diff` still runs to completion. And the queue *between*
  the two ends is bounded as well, not just the reads at either end: a peer that
  pushes faster than this side can parse is cut off at 32 MiB of arrears with an
  error, rather than quietly reassembling the whole diff in a channel. (#247)

- **Sidebar diff preview is optional** — clicking a sidebar row's `+N −N`
  working-tree counts opens the diff overlay, which is the point of them for
  most people but not for everyone. Settings → Window & Tabs → *Open diff
  preview from sidebar counts* turns the click off (`sidebar_diff_preview` in
  `config.json`, on by default). Off, the branch and the counts stay exactly
  where they are and read exactly the same; they simply stop being their own
  click target, so the press falls through to ordinary tab activation like any
  other part of the row. (#247)

- **Kitty graphics protocol, with a shared-memory fast path** — TUIs that
  draw images now render inline in a pane. The daemon intercepts kitty
  graphics escape sequences (`ESC _G…`) in the pane reader before they reach
  scrollback or the client's VT parser — a zero-copy sniff on ordinary
  output, allocating only once a chunk actually carries a graphics command —
  and answers `a=q` capability queries directly on the PTY so probing
  senders see support. Images and deletes travel to the client as compact
  binary frames interleaved with normal output in stream order, so an image
  lands at the cell the sender drew it at; decoding (inflate, BGRA swap,
  atlas placement) runs off the render thread with newest-frame-per-id
  coalescing, so a full frame from a graphics-heavy TUI can't stall PTY
  output or scrolling. For a local pane, file and POSIX shared-memory
  transfers are honored directly — the daemon reads the object and hands the
  client raw pixels, skipping the zlib inflate the compressed-inline path
  would otherwise force. A remote (SSH) pane keeps refusing shm/file and
  rides the compressed-inline path over the tunnel instead. (by @ayamir in
  #272)

### Changed

- **Windows and Linux stop taking keys the shell needs** — `secondary` means
  Cmd on macOS and Ctrl everywhere else, and the default keymap was carried over
  from macOS unchanged. That put window actions straight on top of terminal
  control codes: Ctrl+D could not send EOF (it split the pane), Ctrl+[ could not
  send ESC (it cycled panes), and Ctrl+W, Ctrl+K, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+J, Ctrl+T,
  Ctrl+Q and Ctrl+S were all spoken for. These are window-level bindings with no
  context, so they matched before the terminal ever saw the key — the code that
  sends EOF was there, just unreachable.

  Off macOS the rule is now that `ctrl-<letter>`, `ctrl-[`, `ctrl-]`, `ctrl-\`
  and `ctrl-space` belong to the terminal, and window actions live on
  `ctrl-shift-*` — the convention GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Windows Terminal and
  WezTerm already share. A test enforces it, so the next binding added cannot
  quietly reintroduce the problem.

  | action | was | now |
  |---|---|---|
  | Focus previous / next pane | Ctrl+[ / Ctrl+] | Ctrl+Shift+[ / Ctrl+Shift+] |
  | Split right / down | Ctrl+D / Ctrl+Shift+D | Ctrl+Shift+D / Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D |
  | Close tab | Ctrl+W | Ctrl+Shift+W |
  | New tab | Ctrl+T | Ctrl+Shift+T |
  | Reopen closed tab | Ctrl+Shift+T | Alt+Shift+T |
  | Clear scrollback | Ctrl+K | Ctrl+Shift+K |
  | Command palette | Ctrl+P | Ctrl+Shift+P |
  | Toggle right panel | Ctrl+J | Ctrl+Shift+J |
  | Toggle left panel | unbound | Ctrl+Shift+B |
  | Quit | Ctrl+Q | Ctrl+Shift+Q |
  | Fullscreen | Ctrl+Enter | F11 |
  | Activate tab 1-9 | Ctrl+1-9 | Alt+1-9 |
  | Focus pane by direction | Ctrl+Alt+arrow | Alt+arrow |

  Ctrl+S keeps saving in the code panel but now falls through to the terminal
  when the editor does not have focus, so a shell still receives XOFF.
  Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V and Ctrl+X are unchanged — Ctrl+C still copies only when there
  is a selection and sends SIGINT otherwise — and **Shift+Insert** now pastes.
  With Alt+←/→ focusing panes (Windows Terminal's default), word-by-word
  movement in the prompt editor lives on Ctrl+←/→ — the Windows/Linux text
  convention, which already worked — with Ctrl+Shift+←/→ and Alt+Shift+←/→
  both selecting by word. macOS bindings are untouched. Anything you rebound
  yourself still wins; only the defaults moved. (#270)

- **Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V copy and paste, like every GUI terminal** —
  the chord GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Windows Terminal and WezTerm all teach.
  Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V still work as before; Shift+Insert stays a second paste chord,
  and moving Paste to a key of your own retires both defaults together. Copy
  and Paste now sit in the default keymap table rather than being installed
  behind the scenes, so Settings → Keybindings lists them, records new chords
  for them, and warns when another binding would collide — previously
  Shift+Insert was invisible there and could not be reassigned. (#271)

- **The machine that runs your panes now owns their layout** — the workspace,
  tab and pane tree has moved out of the app and into the background service, so
  one machine has one tree that every client of it reads: the window on it, a
  laptop connected to it across the world, and (next) the session CLI. Clients
  send named edits ("split this pane", "rename that tab") and receive the
  incremental changes other clients make, which is what lets two windows on one
  machine both land their work instead of the last one to save winning. A pane's
  working directory, its coding agent and whether it is still running are now
  observed by the service that owns the PTY rather than remembered by whichever
  client last wrote a file — so after a service restart every pane is *known*
  dead and revives into its recorded directory with its agent conversation
  resumed, with no guessing about which saved ids survived.

  Two consequences worth knowing before you upgrade:

  - **Saved layouts do not carry over.** The tree is a new file
    (`~/.local/share/tty7/machine.json`) and the old `session.json` is not read;
    the upgrade also replaces the background service, which ends the panes it was
    holding. The first launch after upgrading comes up on a fresh workspace, and
    tabs from before it are not recoverable. `views.json` (window geometry and
    which workspaces you had open) replaces `session.json` for the client's own
    half; the old file is left on disk, unread.
  - **Windows keeps its panes but not its layout, for now.** The tree is served
    over the same control channel remote machines use, and that channel is
    Unix-socket-only today, so on Windows tabs do not come back across a restart.
    Panes, splits, agents and shell integration are unaffected within a session.
    (#260)

- **The prompt editor's soft newline is now a rebindable action** — `Shift+Enter`
  and `Alt+Enter` have inserted a literal newline into the command editor since
  the multi-line prompt editor landed, but the chords were hardcoded in the key
  handler: there was no `InsertNewline` to name in `keybindings`, and no way to
  move the gesture to a chord of your own. The behaviour is unchanged out of the
  box — both chords still insert, plain `Enter` still submits the whole buffer —
  but it now runs through an `InsertNewline` action, so it appears in Settings →
  Keybindings and can be rebound like anything else, and rebinding it retires
  both defaults. Only the prompt editor answers it; with a full-screen program on
  the pane the chord reaches the application exactly as before. `⌘⏎` fullscreen
  and `⌘⇧⏎` pane zoom are untouched.

  Two smaller behaviour changes come with it, both aligning on what other
  terminals do. With a completion menu open, the newline chords now insert a
  newline and close the menu instead of accepting the highlighted candidate —
  plain `Enter` remains the key that accepts it. And `Shift+Alt+Enter`, which
  the old modifier test caught by accident, now submits like any other `Enter`:
  keybindings match modifiers exactly, and no terminal treats that three-key
  chord as a newline. (#246)

- **Every header in the window moves it now** — grabbing the window by a header
  is a property of the whole app rather than a per-surface feature, so you never
  have to learn which rows happen to be draggable. The detail panel's section
  title joins the caption rows that already were, wherever the panel draws one —
  every tab off macOS, where that row is also the panel's tab switcher, and the
  remote Files header on macOS. In horizontal-tab mode the strip also keeps a
  bare 80px slice of caption for grabbing: its spacer was a flexible one with no
  minimum, so it collapsed to exactly 0px once the tab chips saturated the row —
  around 7-8 tabs on a 1440px window — leaving nothing to grab but three 6px
  gaps and a hairline above and below the chips. The chip row's fixed-chrome
  reserve is corrected to match: it was a flat 100px, sized when the corner held
  a 30px "+" and a 30px "⋯", and was never raised when the workspace chip
  absorbed the "⋯" menu in #169/#188 — so the row's width budget was ~20px of a
  lie. It now measures the group it is reserving for, ~121px of fixed chrome plus
  the 80px grab handle, so chips reach their minimum width and truncate a tab or
  two sooner. (#252)

- **Large working-tree diffs no longer stall the window** — the diff overlay
  had five costs that all scaled with the size of the tree rather than with
  what it could show. Four were named by issue #239's source-level analysis;
  the fifth, the untracked list, turned up while fixing those. Measured on a
  300-file, 90 000-line, 4.5 MB working-tree diff:

  - The full `git diff HEAD` was read into one `String` before parsing began.
    It is now read incrementally through a new streaming call on `Host`, so
    what is held at once is one 64 KiB read buffer plus the line being
    reassembled rather than the whole diff — and that line is itself capped at
    1 MiB, because a line is only complete at its newline and a minified bundle
    is one line of many megabytes. Measured on this repository's own `git log -p
    -n 400` (8 269 409 bytes of real git output, release build): 8.3 MB resident
    → 64 KiB, and *faster* end to end — 829 ms buffered (817 ms read + 12 ms
    parse) → 557 ms streamed, because parsing now overlaps with git producing
    output instead of waiting for all of it.
  - The parsed snapshot was deep-cloned onto every tab's overlay *on the UI
    update path*. It is now shared behind an `Arc`: 1.99 ms of main-thread
    copying per holder → 10 ns (426 µs → 10 ns even at the new retention
    budget).
  - The per-file 2000-line cap bounded one pathological file but not the sum,
    so two hundred ordinary files could retain 90 000 `DiffLine`s. A repo-wide
    budget now caps retained lines and files-with-hunks — 90 000 lines / 6.2 MiB
    of line text → 20 000 lines / 1.2 MiB — while `+N −N` keeps counting the
    whole diff, so the numbers stay exact and the overlay doesn't re-probe in a
    loop chasing a total it can no longer reach.
  - The untracked list escaped all of the above: `git ls-files --others` reports
    every path not yet ignored, and one un-ignored `node_modules` reached the
    overlay as tens of thousands of rows without touching the diff at all. It is
    now streamed, capped where it is retained and again where it is rendered —
    while the count shown stays the true total, so a capped list never reads as
    files having vanished. It deliberately does *not* drive the collapse-
    everything rule below: folding file bodies shut removes no untracked rows,
    so a tree with an un-ignored dependency directory and three edited files
    would have hidden the three cheap things and kept the expensive one.
  - The 400-line auto-collapse rule was per-file, so sixty medium files all
    opened at once (thousands of side-by-side rows, none of them individually
    large). Past a repo-wide total the overlay now opens with every file
    collapsed — zero rows built — leads with a summary saying the diff is too
    large to render efficiently, and points at expanding individual files or
    `git diff` in the terminal. That total counts the context lines git prints
    around every hunk, which is what is actually rendered, so it sits several
    times above the `+N −N` figure at which it would otherwise fire on an
    ordinary afternoon's work.

- **One `git diff` per repository, not two** — the Changes panel and the diff
  overlay each ran their own full-diff probe and kept their own snapshot of the
  same repository. They now share one probe and one snapshot, so opening both
  costs one shell-out and one parse, and opening the overlay while the panel is
  already showing that repo paints immediately instead of re-probing. (#247)

### Fixed

- **A remote workspace no longer loses or crosses its own layout on reopen
  or restart** — two related failure modes in the same area, closed
  together. Reopening a remote workspace, or coming back to one whose
  `tty7-server` had been replaced, could land on permanently `disconnected`
  panes with the coding-agent conversations gone: there was no way to tell a
  genuinely restarted server (which needs a rebuild from the saved layout
  and fresh shells) from a link that had merely blinked (which just needs
  re-attaching). A new `ControlHelloOk.instance` identifies the server
  *process* so a reconnect can tell the two apart — an absent instance reads
  as unknown, never as a restart — attach failures now fall back to
  spawning instead of stranding the pane in a link-down state, and "End
  Sessions" clears the recorded pane ids so reopening spawns fresh shells
  with `--resume` rather than trying to re-attach to panes that are already
  dead.

  Separately, a restart could materialize one *local* workspace's tabs
  inside a different workspace's window and auto-resume every one of their
  agents a second time — real, duplicate `claude --resume` calls against
  conversations already running elsewhere. The root corruption that seeded
  a workspace's records with another one's panes is still unattributed, but
  every way it could propagate or amplify is now closed: `Spawn` carries
  its owning workspace so restore refuses to attach a pane owned by another
  one; pane ids are bound to the daemon instance that issued them, so an id
  recorded against a dead process can't attach to an unrelated shell after a
  reboot (agent resume still happens on this path, since the pane really is
  gone); deduping two claims on one pane id now strips the loser's agent
  session id and launch flags along with the id, so a corrupted record can't
  double-resume an agent the winner already runs; and saving a session now
  logs an error naming both workspace ids if a window is ever caught holding
  a pane it doesn't own, so a recurrence is caught rather than silently
  re-amplified. All wire and schema changes are backward and forward
  compatible. (#257)

- **A captured pane reads like text, not a stream of raw escape codes, and a
  broken pipe ends quietly** — `tty7 capture --plain` replays a pane's bytes
  through the same `alacritty_terminal` grid the window renders panes with,
  instead of leaving a script to regex-strip escape sequences itself.
  Stripping alone gets the easy 90% and invents the rest: whether 200
  characters with no trailing newline in a 249-column pane is one logical
  line or a soft wrap is a fact about the terminal grid, not about the
  bytes, and the same is true of a `\r`-overwritten progress bar, a
  redrawing shell prompt, and cursor-addressed text. `--plain` now replays
  each streamed segment at the width the daemon actually recorded it with —
  panes on different machines are different widths, and a hardcoded
  assumption would rewrap both wrong — so a captured pane matches what the
  window would have shown. Raw `capture` (no `--plain`) is unchanged: still
  the exact bytes the daemon stored.

  Separately, every CLI verb that outputs to a pipe now ends the way `cat`
  does when the reader hangs up — silently, with the shell's own SIGPIPE
  exit code — instead of a Rust panic and a backtrace on stderr, which most
  verbs produced on something as ordinary as `tty7 ls | head -1`. Rust
  disables `SIGPIPE` by default, so a doomed write surfaces as an
  `io::Error` and `println!` turns that into a panic; the fix restores the
  default disposition on Unix so the kernel handles it directly, and
  recognizes the Windows equivalent (`ERROR_NO_DATA`) at every stdout write
  site since Windows has no signal to hand back to. (#283)

- **Restarting the server no longer strands the window on the home page** —
  after confirming "Restart Server?", the window's post-restart resync could
  go out on the control link to the server that had just been killed: the
  connected flag is an `AtomicBool` the reader thread only flips on EOF, so
  right after `restart()` returns the link often still read as up, the
  layout pull failed against a dead socket, and the failure was logged and
  discarded rather than retried — leaving the window sitting on an empty
  home page with no hint anything was owed to it. A failed hydration is now
  recorded as debt and retried on the next sync, and a window that hasn't
  yet recovered its layout no longer pushes its own (empty) state back to
  the server in the meantime — previously that could diff into "close every
  tab" and erase the layout on disk for a window that was only ever waiting
  its turn. (#282)

- **Tab no longer clears your command line when a remote pane's link is
  down** — `Tab` reaches the prompt editor through a `SendTab` action that
  bypassed the same-input guard ordinary typing goes through, so on a
  reconnecting remote workspace a completion with no candidates handed the
  line off to a dead link anyway: the command vanished, the editor stood
  down for the rest of the prompt cycle, and every keystroke after it —
  Enter included — was swallowed by the very guard the Tab had skipped. The
  guard now covers the Tab path too, so the line stays put and typing
  resumes once the link is back; a late-arriving SFTP completion result is
  also dropped, with the reason logged, rather than acting on a line the
  editor no longer owns. A local pane, which has no notion of a down link,
  is unaffected. (#273)

- **The IME candidate window follows the actual caret, not a parked
  cursor** — typing Chinese in a Kimi CLI pane on Windows stranded the
  candidate list at the input box's bottom-right corner instead of
  following it. Two independent causes stacked: gpui never answered
  `WM_IME_REQUEST` / `IMR_QUERYCHARPOSITION`, which is how Windows 11's
  default Microsoft Pinyin IME asks for caret position — it ignores the
  older `CANDIDATEFORM` call tty7 was already making once per composition —
  so an unanswered query fell back to the IME's own default spot; and Kimi
  CLI itself hides the hardware cursor and draws its own caret as a
  reverse-video cell that never gets parked at the logical input point,
  landing the only real anchor tty7 had at the right edge of the input box's
  border. The fix answers the position query from the input handler and
  re-anchors on every composition update instead of sampling once, and when
  the hardware cursor is hidden and its row holds exactly one caret-sized
  (≤2 cell) inverse run, that run is now read as the IME anchor. Apps that
  show the real cursor (pwsh, vim, current Claude Code) are unaffected; the
  heuristic only applies with the cursor hidden, where the previous anchor
  was arbitrary anyway. (#284)

- **A link that wraps across rows opens the whole URL, not just the clicked
  line** — ⌘-click and ⌘-hover resolved a URL only from the physical grid
  row under the pointer, so a soft-wrapped URL opened its first line only
  and 404'd. OSC 8 hyperlinks now resolve across a soft wrap as one
  contiguous run, using the link's own declared URI rather than
  reconstructing it from the clicked row; bare URLs and file paths resolve
  through the existing soft-wrap stitching, plus a new opt-in mode that also
  bridges a program's own *hard* newline when the row is full to the right
  edge and the last character continues the link into the next row's first
  column — so an ordinary short line is never glued to the next paragraph.
  Double-click word/smart-select is unaffected; only link click and hover
  bridge hard wraps. (by @ayamir in #258)

- **A workspace title stays tied to the workspace** — foreground process and
  agent names no longer replace the workspace title in the sidebar or its
  switcher button. An explicit workspace name wins; otherwise the title is
  derived from the workspace's repo/cwd, with `Untitled` as the final fallback.

- **Fullwidth CJK punctuation no longer overlaps, and prompt-mark scanning
  is faster** — wide glyphs are now shaped independently instead of being
  batched together, which was producing the overlap; OSC prompt-mark
  scanning moves from a byte-by-byte scan to SIMD-backed `memchr`; and Thai
  and Lao SARA AM combining-mark clustering is reconciled with upstream.
  (by @ChihGodlee in #250)

- **tty7 gets a taskbar icon and identity on Linux** — the window now sets
  `app_id: "tty7"` on every platform, which X11 uses as `WM_CLASS` and
  Wayland matches against the packaged `tty7.desktop` entry, so taskbars and
  window switchers can resolve the app's identity and icon where they
  previously couldn't. X11 additionally needs the icon on the window itself
  (`_NET_WM_ICON` ships raw pixels per window rather than reading the
  desktop entry), so `assets/app-icon.png` is decoded once and downscaled to
  256px — the most a taskbar uses — and attached via `WindowOptions::icon`.
  macOS and Windows already got their icons through the bundle and the
  embedded `.ico` respectively and are unaffected. (by @zerolover in #254)

- **Installing a remote server keys off the wire dialect it actually
  speaks, not its version string** — two builds between releases can share a
  version string but not a dialect, which previously let a client adopt an
  incompatible remote server and fail permanently in the handshake instead
  of reinstalling. (#264)

- **Listing WSL distributions no longer hangs the shell menu** — a
  starting-up, updating, or wedged `wsl.exe` is now given a bounded wait
  before the probe reports no distributions, matching what an unreachable
  WSL already produced instead of holding the whole menu open.

- **⌃R on a remote machine searches that machine's history** — tty7 owns ⌃R at
  the prompt and shows its own fuzzy menu, but the store behind it had no notion
  of *where* a command had run. Every pane read one file, so ssh'ing to a server
  and reaching for ⌃R offered the commands you had typed on your laptop —
  worse than offering nothing, since the answers look plausible until you run
  one. History is now kept per machine: the local store stays where it was, and
  each remote gets its own, keyed by the target you connected to. On a remote
  workspace tty7 also reads the far end's own `~/.zsh_history` and
  `~/.bash_history` through the same channel it already uses for git and file
  listings, so the first ⌃R on a freshly connected box has something in it
  rather than starting empty. Switching a pane between machines swaps the store
  under it, and the local history file is untouched by the upgrade. (#270)

- **A Windows clipboard pastes like every other clipboard** — text copied on
  Windows carries `\r\n`, and a bracketed paste forwarded it byte for byte. vim
  counts CR and LF as two line breaks, so pasting a block of code into it left a
  blank line under every line — bad enough to make tty7 unusable for editing.
  Bracketed pastes now fold `\r\n` down to a single `\n`, which is exactly what
  the same paste already produced on Linux and macOS. The non-bracketed path is
  untouched: with no paste mode to distinguish text from typing, a line break
  still has to arrive as the CR the Return key sends. (#270)

- **Closing every window before quitting no longer loses your place** — launch
  only ever restored a workspace that still had a window at quit, so closing them
  one by one and relaunching came up on the empty home page, with no hint that
  four workspaces were sitting there. Closing a window here is a *detach*: its
  panes keep running in the daemon, which makes that workspace every bit as much
  "where you left off" as one that still had a window on screen. Launch now falls
  back to the workspace closed last, and the only launch that comes up on a fresh
  workspace is a genuine first run. Deleting a workspace still means deleting it —
  that is the one gesture that drops it from the file. (#267)

- **An unsubscribed directory watch stops delivering immediately** — dropping a
  local watch handle now closes its delivery channel rather than only asking the
  OS backend to stand down. Tearing that backend down is not instantaneous, and
  on Windows a `ReadDirectoryChangesW` completion can fire *during* teardown and
  reach a consumer that has already unsubscribed. Batches already queued stay
  readable, which is the one thing a consumer racing its own drop may
  legitimately still see. (#247)

- **Rounded UI controls no longer square off their corners**
  ([#236](https://github.com/l0ng-ai/tty7/issues/236)) — the cursor-shape
  toggles (Block / Bar / Underline) are the clearest case: the selected
  segment's fill filled the whole corner of the track it caps, with the track's
  own anti-aliased border arc floating *inside* that square. The controls were
  relying on `overflow_hidden` to shape those fills to the track's rounding, and
  it cannot: gpui's overflow mask is an axis-aligned rectangle with no corner
  radii, tested per fragment as a hard discard, so it can only ever cut a square
  and never anti-aliases the cut. A container's own corners come from the quad
  shader's distance field instead, which is why a plain card looked smooth while
  anything with a filled child in the corner did not. Every such fill now
  carries its own radius, inset one border-width so it nests inside the border
  rather than bulging past it: the segmented controls, the −/value/+ steppers'
  hover fills, the theme picker's flush previews, and the diff overlay's card
  headers and closing rows. Most visible at a device pixel ratio of 1, where the
  hard clip edge is a whole physical pixel wide. (#244)

- **Dragging the window by a title bar worked only rarely with a trackpad** —
  five rows that stand in for the caption (the tab rail's top zone, the settings
  page's top strip, the detail panel's top zone, and the code and diff overlays'
  headers) armed their window-drag with a flag that was rebuilt on every render.
  Any repaint between the press and the first drag event threw the arm away, and
  the press *itself* schedules one — these rows carry a double-click, which makes
  gpui refresh the window on mouse-down — so the drag only survived if the first
  move beat the next vsync: 16ms at 60Hz, 8ms on ProMotion. A mouse press nudges
  the pointer and often won that race; a trackpad press is a finger pushing down
  without translating, and almost never did. The terminal's cursor blink disarmed
  it on its own even without a press. The arm now lives in element state, which
  survives frames — where gpui-component's own `TitleBar` has always kept it,
  which is why the ordinary caption strip was never affected. (#252)

- **An idle window stays idle while a file in the Files panel is being written**
  — the tree watches its roots plus every directory you have expanded, so what
  it hears about is a change in a directory it is *displaying*, and a file's
  contents being rewritten reports exactly as loudly as a file appearing. A
  formatter rewriting in place, an editor saving on every keystroke, a build
  dropping its log next to the sources: each of those repainted the whole
  window, twice over, for as long as it went on. A window with nothing new to
  draw never reached render idle, which is what issue #243 reports in its title.
  A batch now repaints only when the re-read comes back different from what is
  already on screen, and that re-read is issued from the watcher callback rather
  than by asking for a paint in order to get one. A closed Files panel does no
  work at all: the change is recorded and picked up on reopening. A panel showing
  search hits is the same case — the hits are their own walk, so no listing is on
  screen to refresh — and the change is picked up when you clear the search box.
  Real changes still arrive exactly as fast.

  Measured headlessly by counting window draws, before and after: five rewrites
  of a file in a displayed directory cost 10 frames and now cost 0.

  `.gitignore` edits keep their whole-cache refresh, now taken only when the file
  can actually govern a directory the tree holds. That one is a correctness guard
  on the most expensive branch here rather than a measurable saving — the watch
  is non-recursive, so a `.gitignore` has to sit directly in a displayed
  directory to arrive in the first place.

  The other half of that report — the Files panel flickering — was fixed
  independently by "keep file-tree listings on screen while they refresh", which
  landed first and is the mechanism the panel now uses. This is only the frames.
  Note the redraw behaviour is platform-independent and is what that number is
  about; the reporter's ~15% CPU figure, and whether their flicker also
  involved something in the Wayland presentation path, were not reproducible on
  macOS and are not claimed to be confirmed. (#249)

- **Return no longer confirms the file tree's delete prompt** — it was the only
  destructive prompt in tty7 with the destructive action first, and on macOS
  (NSAlert) and Windows (TaskDialog) the first button is the Return-key
  default, so pressing Return deleted — recursive folder deletion included. The
  buttons now put the safe option first, matching every other destructive
  prompt, with Escape still cancelling. Linux uses gpui's click-only fallback
  dialog, so the swap only reorders the buttons there. (#255)

- **"Finder" is no longer named on Linux and Windows** — the file-tree context
  menu and the SFTP job list's reveal tooltip hardcoded Finder-flavoured
  labels on every platform; only the Info row's button was conditional. All
  three sites now share that one conditional, so the action reads "Reveal in
  Finder" on macOS and "Open Folder" everywhere else. On macOS the SFTP
  tooltip's "Show in Finder" becomes "Reveal in Finder" too, retiring a third
  name for the same action. (#255)

- **Grok Build turns up in settings search** — the agent renders a Settings →
  Agents row but had no search-index entry, so searching could never surface
  it. The other five agent entries had drifted from what their rows actually
  say ("Claude Code hooks" for a row titled "Claude Code"), as had "Option
  acts as Meta" from the rendered "Option (⌥) acts as Meta"; the index titles
  now match the rows, the mechanism words (hooks / plugin / extension) stay
  behind as search keywords, and a test derives the Agents index from the
  agent list so a future agent can't ship unsearchable. (#255)

## [26.7.6] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **Readline parity at the prompt** — keys that worked in a raw terminal stopped
  working the moment shell integration engaged, because the local command editor
  owned the keyboard at the prompt and swallowed every chord it didn't
  recognise. `Ctrl-P` / `Ctrl-N` now walk history exactly like ↑ / ↓ (completion
  picker and reverse search included); `Ctrl-Y` yanks back whatever `Ctrl-W` /
  `Ctrl-U` / `Ctrl-K` / `Alt-D` last cut, from a one-slot kill ring of the
  editor's own — zle's ring holds text this editor never cut, so borrowing it
  would paste the wrong thing; and `Alt-.` inserts the previous command's last
  word, repeating to walk further back. Any chord the editor has no answer for
  — `Ctrl-T`, `Alt-U`, a `bindkey`-ed widget — now hands the line to the shell
  so zle's keymap decides, instead of vanishing. Pressing any of them while
  scrolled up snaps the viewport back to the live prompt first, so a recalled
  line can't be edited off-screen. (#222)

- **One Dark Pro built-in theme** — a ninth built-in, slotted alphabetically
  among the dark themes. Two deliberate departures from the VS Code theme's
  terminal set, both caught by this repo's contrast tests: the accent is the
  editor's focus blue `#528bff` rather than the syntax blue, which sits at the
  same luminance as the switch knob it has to be legible against; and normal red
  stays the classic `#e06c75`, because the Pro terminal red lands too close to
  the warning orange to stay distinguishable. (#224)

- **Panes are told which terminal they're running in** — every pane now carries
  `TERM_PROGRAM=tty7` and `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION`, the de-facto standard pair
  Apple Terminal introduced and iTerm2, WezTerm, Ghostty, VS Code and tmux all
  set. `TERM` names terminfo capabilities and can't answer "which program is
  this", so without the pair, capability probes (`supports-color`,
  `supports-hyperlinks`, and the CLI ecosystem built on them), editors applying
  terminal-specific workarounds, and shell prompts all fell back to their most
  conservative behaviour. tty7's own `TTY7` marker doesn't help them — it exists
  so globally-installed agent hooks stay silent in other terminals, and nothing
  third-party knows to look for it. Unlike `TERM` and `COLORTERM`, both new
  variables can be overridden from `env` in `config.json`: they name an
  identity, not a capability, and posing as another terminal is a legitimate way
  to get a tool that only recognises a fixed list to light up. Local panes only
  — ssh forwards environment variables solely by agreement between client and
  server, so a remote host still sees whatever it sets for itself. (#219)

- **Inactive panes only fade if you want them to** — a split tab dims every pane
  but the focused one so the active terminal reads as foreground. That is the
  right default, but it is not free: at 55% opacity a dim theme's comment color
  or a long-running build's output in the pane you are *watching* rather than
  typing into gets harder to read, and some people track panes by cursor alone
  and never needed the cue. Settings → Appearance → Transparency now carries a
  "Dim inactive panes" switch. On by default, so nothing changes for anyone who
  was happy; off renders every pane at full opacity. (#214)

### Changed

- **One fewer duplicate SVG stack in the build** — the resvg 0.47 bump (#227)
  left the gpui fork on 0.45, so the tree compiled two resvg/usvg/tiny-skia
  stacks. The fork now pins 0.47 too, re-unifying its stack with the one tty7
  uses for the tray icon. (#237)

- **The last duplicate SVG stack is gone** — after #227 and #237 unified tty7
  and the gpui fork on resvg 0.47, the gpui-component fork still declared its
  own `resvg = "0.45.1"`, keeping a legacy resvg/usvg/tiny-skia 0.45/0.11
  stack in the tree. That fork now pins 0.47 as well, so the whole build
  compiles a single resvg stack. (#238)

### Fixed

- **Box-drawing characters no longer break into dashes between rows** — they
  rendered as font glyphs, and a glyph only covers the font's own line height
  while the cell is `font_size × line_height` (1.4 by default). At any line
  height above 1.0 every vertical run of `│` `╭` `╰` was perforated at each row
  boundary: two-line prompts never closed their corners, TUI frames were dotted
  down both sides. U+2500–U+257F and U+2580–U+259F are now drawn as native
  geometry pinned to the cell's real edges — the same special case kitty,
  Alacritty, WezTerm and iTerm2 all ship, and what tty7's Powerline separators
  already did. Covers mixed light/heavy weights, the double-line set with its
  junctions left open, rounded corners, dashes, diagonals, block eighths and the
  ░▒▓ shades. (#229)

- **Underlines survived box-drawing characters, and strokes stay one weight at
  fractional DPI** — two things the native-drawing path changed without meaning
  to, both invisible at the integer device scale it was developed on. An `ESC[4m`
  span or a hovered URL showed a one-column hole wherever it crossed a box
  character, because the underline rides the shaped text run and the native cell
  returned before building one; the cell now shapes a space in its own style, so
  gpui draws the line from the same `UnderlineStyle` as its neighbours. And at
  125% / 150% / 175% display scaling a vertical rule alternated thin/thick across
  every column, since a logical stroke width that isn't a whole number of device
  pixels rounds differently per column; widths are now laid off the snapped near
  edge in whole device pixels. Nothing changes at 1x or 2x. (#234)

- **Thai SARA AM lost its vowel and rendered as a dotted circle** — `ำ` (U+0E33)
  is width 1 and correctly gets its own column, but it is not atomic to the
  shaper: rustybuzz decomposes it and moves the nikhahit backwards onto the base
  consonant, which needs the base in the same run. It was being segmented alone,
  so there was nothing to reorder onto. A following SARA AM is now absorbed into
  the preceding cell's cluster, so base, tone mark and vowel shape together. Lao
  SARA AM (U+0EB3) takes the same path and comes along. (#230)

- **Italic CJK rendered as unrelated CJK on Windows** — every character came out
  as a different character, one for one, consistently, so it read as a broken
  locale or a mangled encoding. It was neither. Hack, the bundled default, has no
  CJK, so those cells are shaped by the font-fallback chain; gpui's Windows
  backend then threw away the face DirectWrite shaped with and looked a fresh one
  up by family, weight and style. That round trip mapped DirectWrite's *italic*
  to *oblique* — the two are numbered the other way around in the API — and a
  family with no oblique face resolved to its upright one. The glyph indices were
  right; the outlines they were pointing into belonged to a different face. Fixed
  in our gpui fork by rasterizing the face DirectWrite actually chose, which also
  closes a latent use-after-free in the same cache: it keyed fonts by a raw
  pointer to a face nothing held a reference to. (#233)

## [26.7.5] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Tab completes remote paths in an SSH pane** — path candidates came off the
  local filesystem, so a native-SSH pane deliberately passed no cwd and Tab
  found nothing; a no-match hands the line to the shell, which costs the inline
  editor until the next prompt. Since paths are what people complete most, in
  practice every path Tab in an SSH session dropped the user back to the raw
  shell. Tab now lists the remote directory over the pane's own authenticated
  connection — the same request the SFTP panel browses with — so nothing is
  echoed into the scrollback and no prompt hooks are involved. `cd` still filters
  to directories. Command position and `~/` still fall through, as does a
  foreground `ssh` typed into a local shell or a WSL pane, neither of which has a
  tty7-owned connection to ask. (#217)

- **The last-window close confirmation can be turned off** — Settings → Window &
  Tabs gains **Confirm before closing the last window**, on by default. The
  prompt is a teaching device, not a safety net: ⌘Q, the tray's Quit and the
  palette all quit without asking, and nothing is lost either way since the panes
  keep running in the daemon. Once that model is learned, an extra dialog on
  every quit is friction. Brings the window-close prompt in line with the SSH
  close warning, which has had a toggle all along. (#206)

- **The detail panel and tab rail have a scrollbar** — Info / Outline / Changes,
  the file tree, the remote SFTP listing and the tab rail all scrolled with a
  container that painted nothing, so a deep tree or a long tab list gave no hint
  that there was more content or where in it you were. The bar takes its colours
  from the active theme rather than a stock grey, and follows the platform:
  auto-hiding on macOS, permanently visible on Windows and Linux. (#193)

- **Foreground applications can negotiate the Kitty keyboard protocol** — the
  embedded terminal config inherited `kitty_keyboard: false`, so the parser
  ignored the negotiation sequences and an application asking for progressive
  enhancement fell back to `modifyOtherKeys`, which tty7 doesn't implement. That
  collapsed distinct chords onto the same legacy byte — `Shift+Enter` reached the
  application as a plain carriage return, submitting a prompt instead of
  inserting a soft newline. Legacy input is unchanged until an application opts
  in. (#184)

- **The window's leading corner carries the app's mark off macOS** — macOS fills
  the top-left with the traffic lights; on Windows and Linux that corner was
  empty, with everything the caption row holds (the rail's "+" and collapse, the
  corner chrome, the window controls) pushed to a right edge. The "duo" mark now
  heads the tab rail on its content inset, the line the search box and every row
  label below it start on, and follows the rail's controls into the title strip
  when the sidebar is collapsed — so the corner never falls back to nothing.
  Drawn, never clicked: it takes no hover capsule and no hit box, leaving the
  strip grabbable through it. (#202)

### Changed

- **Interaction state and status colours are derived from the active theme**
  ([#197](https://github.com/l0ng-ai/tty7/issues/197)) — a segmented control's
  selected option was indistinguishable from its neighbours on *every* bundled
  theme (Dracula worst at 1.03:1), because the theme had a colour model but no
  state model: fixed blend ratios scattered across the code, plus every
  gpui-component field nobody had noticed still carrying stock greys and Tailwind
  hues. Each painting surface now carries a state ladder derived to hit a
  contrast *ratio* against that surface, so the result no longer drifts with the
  theme — selected-vs-resting goes from 1.20–1.47:1 to 1.70–1.72:1, anchored so
  Dracula's already-signed-off highlight is a no-op. Ladders are per surface, so
  a menu row anchors to the popover it actually sits on. Taking a fill now also
  takes its paired label colour, instead of each site hand-fixing that
  separately. `danger`/`warning`/`success`/`info`/`link` come from the theme's
  own ANSI-16 at 33 call sites — Dracula's delete button is literally the
  `#ff5555` the terminal in the same window paints with. Switches were inverted
  on every dark theme (a near-black knob on a light track, invisible on the dark
  one) and now take the light end of the theme's axis with the accent on the
  checked track. (#205)

- **The bundled icon set is redrawn to one humanist spec** — the previous set
  accumulated one exception at a time: a heavier `plus` because a bare cross
  looked frail, a `stock/` prefix to undo overrides that were too heavy at 16px,
  two names sharing one drawing. All 17 glyphs now hold to a single spec — 2.1
  stroke throughout, corner radii matching the app's 10px panels, near-square
  boxes of equal apparent area, round caps and joins everywhere. Metaphors are
  untouched, so nothing needs relearning; `folder-closed` gains an inner rule
  that distinguishes it from `folder`, and `info` a title bar that stops it
  colliding with `panel-left`. (#190)

- **The title bar spans the detail panel off macOS** — the panel was a
  full-height column *beside* the bar, and the bar lays out ─ ▢ ✕ at its own
  right end, so opening the panel on Windows or Linux stranded the window
  controls mid-window with the panel's grey to their right. Layout moves to
  `[rail | col(bar / row(body, panel))]` so the bar reaches the corner, with the
  caption row over the panel painted in the panel's own surface — the column
  reads as one continuous sidebar from the very top instead of starting 40px down
  in a different colour. The panel's tab tiles move into the section header it
  was already drawing, since a tile row of its own made three stacked headers
  before a single line of content. macOS is untouched. (#188)

### Fixed

- **Splitting or un-maximizing a pane you were hovering no longer kills the app**
  ([#201](https://github.com/l0ng-ai/tty7/issues/201)) — a pane remembers the
  cell under the pointer (that's what makes ⌘-hover underline links), and nothing
  invalidated it when the grid shrank underneath. The remembered row then named a
  line the grid no longer had, and the next modifier press indexed the grid with
  it — inside a gpui input callback, which is `extern "C"` and cannot unwind, so
  the process aborted with the message lost. `⌘⇧D`, `⌘⇧⏎` and dragging the window
  smaller were all reliable ways to hit it. The hovered cell is dropped on resize
  and the row is validated before indexing. Two other aborts went with it: `⌘T` /
  `⌘D` against a dead daemon now restarts it and retries once, and session
  restore with an unreachable daemon restores what it can instead of dying. A
  panic anywhere in the GUI now also lands in `<config-dir>/crash.log` with its
  message, location and backtrace — the OS report only ever kept the abort.
  (#204)

- **Emoji written with a variation selector take their real width and
  presentation** ([#203](https://github.com/l0ng-ai/tty7/issues/203)) — `🗂️`,
  `❤️` and `⚠️` were budgeted one column, so the glyph bled over its neighbour
  and every following cell on the line shifted left by one, taking selection and
  click hit-testing with it. The selector is zero-width and lands *after* the
  base's column budget is spent, and nothing revisited the decision. The same
  gap made `❤️` render as the black text-presentation heart, identical to bare
  `❤`, because only `cell.c` reached the shaper — dropping every combining mark,
  not just variation selectors. The terminal now re-scores the sequence and
  widens the cell, and carries the marks through to be shaped with their base:
  `❤️` and `⚠️` come up in colour while their bare forms stay monochrome, and
  `e` + U+0301 renders as `é`. Narrowing (`U+FE0E` on an already-wide emoji) is
  still not implemented — it would have to free a column and reflow the line.
  (#210, #216)

- **Untrusted terminal output can no longer freeze a pane** — with Kitty
  keyboard negotiation enabled, an upstream `alacritty_terminal` bug became
  reachable: `push_keyboard_mode` caps its stack by removing from the *title*
  stack, a copy-paste slip that compiles because both are `Vec`s. With an empty
  title stack that panics and kills the reader thread, freezing the pane; with a
  non-empty one it silently drops a saved title, so a later restore returns the
  wrong one. It doesn't take hostile output — a TUI that pushes without popping
  reaches the 4096 cap on its own in a long session, and `cat` of a crafted file
  or a remote host over SSH gets there in one ~20KB burst. Pinned to a patched
  fork, with a regression test that guards the pin. (#194)

- **`theme_follow_system` no longer panics every launch on Linux** — flipping
  "sync with system" on in Settings persists immediately, so the app then aborted
  on every start until `config.json` was hand-edited back, with a backtrace
  pointing at gpui internals and nothing connecting it to the theme toggle. gpui's
  Wayland and X11 backends dispatch the appearance-changed callback while the
  platform client's `RefCell` is already mutably borrowed, and reading
  `cx.window_appearance()` from that callback re-borrows the same cell. The OS
  appearance is now cached in a global that the observer fills from the window's
  own cell, so nothing on the re-entrant path touches the client. macOS and
  Windows were never affected. (#181)

- **A config file saved with a UTF-8 BOM no longer wipes your settings** — every
  config-dir file is read by a loader that treats any parse error as "there is
  no file", falling back to defaults. `serde_json` rejects the U+FEFF a BOM puts
  before the opening brace, so a BOM didn't report a broken config — it reported
  an absent one, and tty7 came up on defaults with nothing in the log to explain
  it. Windows makes this easy to hit by accident: PowerShell's `>`, `Out-File`
  and `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` all write a BOM, so editing `config.json`
  from a shell was enough to lose every setting. `config.json`, `session.json`
  (which lost every workspace the same way) and hand-authored `themes/*.yaml`
  now skip a leading BOM. (#215)

- **New tabs and splits open in the right directory even when the shell can't be
  instrumented** ([#187](https://github.com/l0ng-ai/tty7/issues/187)) — a pane
  learned its directory from `OSC 7`, which only shells tty7 injects its
  integration into ever emit. A shell that `exec`s into another one from its rc
  file (`exec fish` at the end of `.zshrc`), a nested shell started by hand, or
  any shell with no integration at all emitted none — and because a pane's
  directory is seeded with the one it was spawned in, such a pane didn't report
  *no* directory, it reported a permanently stale one. New tabs, splits, the git
  probe and path completion all followed it to the wrong place, with nothing on
  screen to say why. The pane now also reads its directory from the process
  table, on the same half-second foreground poll that already detects SSH
  sessions and coding agents. A shell that does emit `OSC 7` keeps its own
  spelling of the path: `$PWD` preserves the symlinked route the user walked in
  through, and that is the one a new tab should open in. macOS and Linux;
  Windows has no equivalent process query and is unchanged. (#207)

- **Links open on Ctrl+click on Windows and Linux**
  ([#183](https://github.com/l0ng-ai/tty7/issues/183)) — the link modifier was
  the platform key, which gpui maps to ⌘ on macOS but to Win/Super elsewhere, a
  key the OS mostly swallows. Off macOS neither the hover underline nor
  click-to-open could be triggered at all, and the only way to follow a URL was
  to select and copy it — while `config.json`'s own docs had promised
  "⌘/Ctrl-click" all along. Now the same portable secondary modifier the
  keybindings already use, so ⌃-click keeps meaning right-click on macOS.
  Settings copy and the docs follow the platform. (#192)

- **Option-as-Meta works with a CJK input source**
  ([#177](https://github.com/l0ng-ai/tty7/issues/177)) — macOS gives Option two
  jobs, and routes the chord before the terminal sees it. With a non-ASCII input
  source active, ⌥F went to the IME, which committed `ƒ` and consumed the event,
  so the code that turns the chord into `ESC f` never got a say. The setting
  worked on ASCII layouts and silently did nothing on CJK ones, which is why it
  read as intermittent rather than broken. gpui can now decide per keystroke
  rather than once per view, so Meta chords are claimed by the terminal while
  ordinary text, dead keys and Pinyin composition still reach the IME. gpui
  accordingly moves to the `l0ng-ai/zed` fork. (#191)

- **A whole command cycle arriving in one read reports both prompt states** —
  the OSC sniffer folded a chunk's shell-integration marks into one state and
  sent a single frame, hiding the prompt boundary the client counts to tell a
  fresh prompt from a same-prompt redraw. Routine over SSH, where a fast
  command's start mark, output and completion mark leave the remote in one
  packet. Marks on the same side of a boundary still fold, so an ordinary prompt
  draw costs one frame as before. (#217)

- **The detail-panel toggle stops drawing itself as selected, and the Files
  dotfile switch moves into the tree's right-click menu** — follow-ups to the
  caption-row rework, which left the toggle permanently lit and the dotfile
  control competing for room on the header line. (#188)

- **The editor and diff overlays keep their header on the caption line when the
  detail panel is open** — off macOS the title bar is hoisted above
  `[terminal | panel]` so the ─ ▢ ✕ group can reach the window's corner, which
  left both overlays — anchored to the terminal column — starting 40px down.
  Their headers are drawn to *be* the title bar while they're up (its height,
  its insets, a full chrome tile for their one control), and instead landed a
  row low, level with the panel's tab row. They now hang on the row that owns
  the bar, inset by the panel's width, so the corner chrome keeps its surface
  and its clicks. (#202)
- **Those headers became real title bars** — dragging one now moves the window
  and double-clicking zooms it. Both covered the caption row and neither did
  either, with the panel open or closed, so opening a file turned the top of the
  window into a 40px strip that looked exactly like a title bar and answered
  nothing. Their controls (the ✕, the diff's back-to-all-files chip) are
  `occlude()`d to keep taking clicks: a drag region on Windows is HTCAPTION, and
  the OS claims the press before the app hit-tests. Double-clicking a stand-in
  title bar zooms the window on Linux too. (#202)
- **The rail's top zone lines up with the title bar to the pixel** — the bar
  reserves a hairline inside its own height that the rail's stand-in row didn't,
  so everything in that row sat half a pixel low. Invisible on the line-art
  tiles; not on the mark, which visibly hopped as collapsing the rail handed it
  over to the bar. (#202)
- **CJK and emoji stop falling through to the OS on Windows and Linux** — the
  default `font_fallbacks` named only faces that ship with macOS (Menlo, Apple
  Color Emoji), so off macOS the entire chain matched nothing and every
  ideograph and pictograph was resolved by the platform's own cascade instead.
  The bundled Hack primary carries no CJK at all, so on Windows this was every
  Chinese character in every pane. Defaults are now chosen per platform —
  PingFang SC / Apple Color Emoji on macOS, Microsoft YaHei / Segoe UI Emoji on
  Windows, Noto on Linux — and those stock names are appended to a
  hand-written list as well, so a `config.json` that predates this change (or
  was copied from another machine) is repaired at use time without being
  rewritten. Maple Mono NF CN stays first on every platform: its 1.2em CJK
  advance is the only exact fit for the two-column slot Hack's 0.60205em cell
  produces, so a 1.0em stock face is left-aligned there with the remaining
  ~0.2em showing as a gap on the right of each character. (#195)

## [26.7.4] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **Grok Build gets the full hook integration** — Settings → Agents grows a
  sixth row, installing tty7's hooks to `~/.grok/hooks/tty7.json`. A grok pane
  now carries the same live status the other agents do (blue "working" → green
  "done", amber "needs you" when grok asks a question), and after a restart it
  relaunches `grok --resume <id>` with the original launch flags instead of a
  bare shell. Panes that only ever had the Claude Code hooks installed are
  relabeled to grok rather than reporting as "Claude Code", and grok's brand
  mark replaces the generic robot avatar. (#174)
- **Edit, File and Help menus** — copy/cut/paste/select-all, undo/redo and
  find/find-next now live in a real Edit menu; `About tty7`, `Check for
  Updates…`, `Hide tty7` and Services sit in the app menu; Docs, Discord and
  `Report an Issue` are reachable from Help; and tab actions that used to exist
  only in a context menu (Rename Tab, New Worktree Tab, Close Other Tabs, Close
  Tabs to the Right, Copy Working Directory) are real actions you can also find
  in the palette and rebind in Settings. (#175)

### Changed

- **The menu bar follows the HIG** — `tty7 · File · Edit · View · Window ·
  Help` replaces `tty7 · Shell · Window · View`. The `Shell` menu is gone: its
  new / close / split / rename items are File's job everywhere else, and the
  name collided with Settings → Shell, which configures something entirely
  different. View gained the layout toggles and pane commands that were
  chord-only, and `Delete Workspace…` moved behind its own rule at the bottom
  of File. (#175)
- **The command palette is ranked, banded, and says what it will do** — results
  are scored rather than filtered, so word-initials and prefixes outrank
  scattered letters; the idle list opens on `Recent` (frecency) followed by
  Tabs & Panes · Workspaces · View · Terminal · SSH · Agents · Application
  instead of 47 flat rows. Names describe the outcome and the current state
  (`Hide Left Sidebar`, `Tab Bar: Move to Left Sidebar`) rather than the switch,
  one namespace prefix per subsystem, and the naming grammar is written down at
  the top of `palette.rs`. (#175)
- **Settings re-sectioned around what you're configuring** — the orphan `Shell`
  page folds into Terminal's first group, a new `Input` page collects the prompt
  editor, selection/clipboard and keyboard settings, Terminal drops from seven
  groups to four, and notifications moved to Window & Tabs where the rest of the
  app-level behaviour lives. The search index grew from 14 entries to 51 with
  titles pinned to the rendered row labels, so `opacity`, `blur`, `completion`,
  `ctrl-r` and `grouping` now find their rows. (#175)
- **The tab bar defaults to the left sidebar** — a fresh install opens with the
  vertical tab rail instead of the horizontal title-bar strip. Anyone who has
  flipped the setting or hit `ToggleTabSidebar` has an explicit value persisted
  and keeps their layout. (#171)
- **Idle chrome tiles paint at the rail's ink weight** — title-bar toggles,
  panel tabs, `+` and their siblings now draw their glyph in
  `sidebar_foreground` instead of the near-black `foreground`, with full
  strength reserved for the selected tile. The chrome no longer reads a step
  darker than everything it neighbours, and "on" gets a second cue beyond the
  grey capsule. (#176)

### Fixed

- **Non-ASCII output survives a Finder/Dock launch** — macOS GUI launches can
  omit every locale variable, leaving the shell in the C locale: `ls` printed
  one `?` per non-ASCII byte, so a CJK filename came out as `??????`, and tmux
  replaced each Unicode cell with `_`. New shells now receive a UTF-8 character
  locale (`LC_CTYPE` only, so message/date/number localization is untouched)
  derived from the system locale the way Terminal.app does it, and only when no
  inherited or configured locale exists — explicit locale choices still win.
  The derived name is checked against the locales actually installed before it
  is exported, so it stays loadable on remote hosts too, where ssh forwards
  `LC_*` by default.
  ([#178](https://github.com/l0ng-ai/tty7/issues/178), #173, #180)
- **Right-click Paste dropped images, and Copy looked disabled** — copy, cut,
  paste and undo each had two implementations, a chord handler and an action
  handler, which had drifted: the context menu's Paste skipped the image branch
  ⌘V had, so pasting a screenshot into an agent pane worked by keyboard but not
  by menu, and Copy rendered disabled whenever the selection lived in the prompt
  editor rather than the terminal grid. Both now route through one method each.
  (#175)
- **The palette named the other window's sidebar** — the stateful palette titles
  read the config copies of `sidebar_collapsed` / `right_panel_visible`, which
  only record whichever window toggled them last. With two windows in different
  states, one window's palette offered "Show Left Sidebar" while its rail was
  already out. Each window now labels the toggles from its own chrome state.
  (#175)
- **No more update prompts for a half-built release** — the release step ran
  inside the build matrix, so the first platform to finish published a release
  carrying only its own assets, and that release became `/releases/latest`
  immediately. The in-app update check polls exactly that endpoint, so users
  were prompted to download a version whose `.dmg` was still notarizing. All
  four platforms now upload artifacts and a single gated job assembles one
  **draft** release with every asset. (#172)

## [26.7.3] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- **Multiple windows, one workspace each** — `New Workspace` (⌘⇧N) opens a
  second window with its own tabs, splits, and chrome state. A workspace is
  the persistent thing: closing its window puts it away with its panes still
  running in the daemon, and the title bar's workspace menu, the command
  palette, and the home page's picker all bring it back. `Stop Workspace`
  ends one for real (no default chord — it kills sessions), `Delete
  Workspace` also forgets the layout, and a workspace can be renamed from
  the title-bar chip. (#169)
- **Workspace switcher, in the two places you'd look** — a title-bar chip
  (monogram + chevron) whose menu lists every workspace with a monogram badge
  and a corner dot for the ones whose shells are still running, and the macOS
  **Window** menu listing the same set: on screen first, then the detached ones
  with how long ago you left them. Both show the first nine. (#169)
- **Detail panel** — a docked right-hand column that shows what the active
  pane *is* rather than what it's printing: **Info** (cwd, branch, shell,
  agent, the process tree and the TCP ports the pane is listening on),
  **Outline**, **Changes**, and **Files** (a local file tree). Opening a file
  from it lifts a code editor overlay over the terminal. (#158)
- **Port forwarding and SFTP live in the detail panel** — a native-SSH pane's
  forwards are listed, added and removed from the Info tab, and its remote
  filesystem browses from the Files tab, with transfers reported in a footer
  that rides under every tab. (#166)
- **Shell integration in native SSH panes** — OSC 133 prompt marks, exit
  codes and cwd reporting now reach zsh, bash and fish on the far side, so
  the inline line editor works in an SSH pane exactly as it does locally.
  (#152)
- **Live drag-to-reorder** — tabs rearrange under the cursor the way Chrome
  and Warp do (the dragged tab stays in the list and the ones it passes slide
  out of the way) in the strip, the sidebar rows, and whole repo groups.
  (#151)
- **The rail's top strip drags the window** — the sidebar's title-bar-height
  top zone now moves the window on drag and zooms it on double-click, like
  the title bar it sits level with. (#153)
- **The ⌃R history menu can be switched off** — Settings → Terminal →
  Keyboard, or `history_search` in `config.json`. With it off, the prompt
  line is handed to the shell and the raw `^R` follows it, so a binding
  of your own (fzf, percol, plain reverse-i-search) answers instead of
  tty7's menu. (#163, #170)

### Changed

- **Sidebar and right-panel visibility are per-window** — toggling one
  window's chrome leaves the others alone. The config value is now what a
  *newly opened* window starts with; panel width stays shared. (#169)
- **Chrome icons draw at the size they were asked to** — every tile glyph in
  the window (title bar, rail, panel tabs, overlay headers) had been rendering
  at 12px regardless of the size its call site set, because the button widget
  overwrites its icon's size from its own. The tile rhythm is now stated once
  and applied from one helper, so the marks read at their intended weight and
  the hover capsule keeps a consistent gap from the window edge. (#169)
- **The panel and chrome glyphs are drawn to one spec** — the detail panel's
  tab marks and the title bar's own were redrawn so a row of icons stops
  reading as a row of icons from different sets, and every icon tile shares
  one soft hover fill. (#161)
- **Multi-line commands submit as one bracketed paste** — a 30-line block
  costs one prompt cycle instead of thirty, so it no longer retypes itself
  down the screen on Enter. (#164)
- **The file tree lists directories off the render thread** — `read_dir`, the
  `.gitignore` chain and the search walk left the paint, so a cold cache or a
  large repo no longer stalls a frame. (#160)
- **The LSP client is gone** — opening a `.rs` file in the code panel silently
  spawned rust-analyzer, which indexed the whole workspace for hundreds of
  megabytes of RAM. A terminal shouldn't do that to you on a click, and the
  fix is removal rather than a switch for something nobody asked for. (#159)
- **Sidebar rows float their close button** — the ✕ no longer reserves a
  permanent trailing column, so labels and branch lines get the full rail
  width, and it stays clear of a row's `+n −n` counts. (#145)
- **Daemon wire protocol is now v2** — WSL panes carry a remote-context kind
  that a v1 client can't decode, so it would drop the pane's connection
  instead of ignoring the unknown value. The version handshake now sees that
  skew and offers to restart the daemon, rather than letting a downgraded
  build lose panes silently. (#169)
- **`Cargo.lock` is checked against `Cargo.toml` in CI** — release builds now
  run `--locked`, so a drifted lockfile fails the build instead of quietly
  resolving something else. (#150)

### Fixed

- **⌃J and ⌃M submit the line again** — accept-line's control codes were
  swallowed at the prompt as unrecognized Ctrl chords, so the keys did
  nothing. They now take the same path Enter does, completion picker and
  history menu included. (#163, #170)
- **The sidebar's git counts keep up** — `+N −N` refreshes as an agent's tool
  calls land (throttled per repo) and when the window regains focus, instead
  of going stale until you happened to run a command in that pane. (#149)
- **`ToggleSftp` earns its name** — pressing it while the panel is already on
  Files closes the panel rather than being a dead press, and the remote
  browser's 500ms transfer poll now ends itself when the panel closes instead
  of depending on the render path to retire it. (#167)
- **Closing the last window from the home page quits** — it used to leave a
  windowless process in the Dock that no longer responded to being clicked.
  (#147, #148)
- **Windows titlebar chrome** — the `⋯` menu sits back on the native
  window-control rhythm, and the sidebar's collapse / new-tab buttons take
  their clicks again instead of being swallowed by the drag region. (#162)
- **Windows: the theme panel's close button did nothing** — and the repo group
  header showed a plain arrow where every other row shows a pointer. (#155,
  #156)
- **Settings keeps its stock glyphs** — the page's own icons stopped being
  restyled by the chrome tile pass, and its close button is sized to the title
  bar's rhythm rather than reading undersized beside the window controls.
  (#157, #165)

## [26.7.2] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **WSL shell integration** — prompt marks, cwd tracking, and agent
  detection now work inside WSL distros. The integration tags the shell
  it actually launches, never blocks the spawn path while probing the
  distro's shell, and declines untranslatable cwds rather than
  misreporting them. (#134)
- **Git Bash shell integration on Windows** — Git Bash panes get the
  full integration, reporting proper Windows paths for cwd-dependent
  features. (#130)
- **Smart double-click selection** — double-click selects the word under
  the cursor with language-aware boundaries, including CJK segmentation
  (the OS tokenizer on macOS, jieba elsewhere); angle-bracket pairs must
  hug their contents and contraction apostrophes stay out of quote
  pairing. (#128)
- **Configurable file-link command** — file links can open with a custom
  command instead of the default editor. Contributed by @ayamir. (#143)
- **Agent resume keeps launch flags** — resuming an agent session
  carries the flags the agent was originally launched with onto the
  resume command. (#144)
- **Sidebar git line follows the agent's cwd** — the branch/status line
  under an agent tab tracks the directory the agent is actually working
  in, not just the pane's shell. (#127)

### Changed

- **Tab close button floats over the label** — the close affordance no
  longer reserves a slot in every tab, so labels get the full width
  until hovered. (#126)
- **Dependency updates** — resvg 0.47, sha2 0.11, a cargo minor-patch
  group bump, and newer CI artifact actions. (#137, #138, #139, #140,
  #141)

### Fixed

- **Tab completion falls through to the shell** — a Tab tty7 has no
  candidates for now hands the line to the shell's own completion
  instead of being swallowed (remote panes included); `cd`/`pushd` stop
  offering files; and the whole feature can be turned off with
  `tab_completion` in config or Settings → Terminal → Keyboard. (#146)
- **Remote panes never leak local filesystem operations** — a remote
  pane's cwd is no longer used for local path lookups, and the agent-cwd
  bypass validates inherited directories. (#133)
- **macOS text input goes through the IME** — synthesized keystrokes
  keep their text (remote/automated input no longer degrades), and Kitty
  full mode stays off the IME path. (#132)
- **No more console flashes on Windows git probes** — git status probes
  and ssh ProxyCommand children no longer flash console windows. (#129)
- **Windows titlebar menu spacing** — the titlebar "..." aligns with the
  window-control rhythm. (#131)
- **Codex avatar and macOS tray sizing** — the Codex tab avatar uses its
  black brand field, and the tray icon renders at 22pt instead of the
  hardcoded 18pt. (#142)
- **Agents settings layout** — rows stay aligned and notes terse. (#125)

## [26.7.1] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Follow the OS appearance** — a "Sync with system" mode with separate
  light and dark theme slots: the theme flips live when the OS switches
  appearance, native chrome follows along, and picking a theme while
  syncing writes the slot matching the current mode. Old configs are
  unchanged (sync defaults off). (#121)
- **Mark as Unread on tabs** — the tab context menu can re-flag a finished
  agent result you've already looked at, re-arming the unread badge on the
  Done dot. Agent tabs only; disabled while the agent is still working.
  (#120)

### Changed

- **"Duo" logo refresh** — a new brand mark (two offset session panes,
  mint behind ink, with a prompt chevron) replaces the orange window
  identity across every icon asset: app icon, logo, tray glyph, favicon,
  and social preview. Bare macOS binaries (`cargo run`) now show the icon
  in the Dock too. (#124)

### Fixed

- **Linked git worktrees group under their main repository** — the sidebar
  keys groups on the repository home instead of each worktree's own root,
  so a repo and its worktrees share one header while branch status stays
  per-worktree. (#118)
- **macOS tray icon stays a template image in every state** — the
  attention state no longer swaps in a grey non-template glyph that was
  illegible on many menu-bar appearances; agent status lives in the
  tooltip and tray menu. (#122)
- **No more console-window flashes from Windows agent hooks** — each hook
  emitter frees its throwaway console before it can paint (debug builds
  only; release builds were unaffected). (#119)

## [26.7.0] - 2026-07-16

First CalVer release: versions are now `YY.M.PATCH`, so the number says when
it shipped rather than what changed.

### Added

- **Coding-agent detection on Windows** — the agent status dot now works on
  Windows: agents are detected from the shell-integration command capture
  (no `/proc` there), hook status events reach the daemon via the agent's
  ancestor console, and mark-derived detection only re-fires when the
  command capture actually changes. (#115)
- **Clipboard image paste for agents off macOS** — pasting a screenshot into
  a coding-agent pane on Windows/Linux stages the image to a temp file and
  pastes its shell-escaped path (the same route drag-and-drop uses); Windows
  BMP screenshots are transcoded to PNG since agent vision rejects BMP.
  macOS keeps the higher-fidelity pasteboard read. (#117)
- **Nightly build channel** — `main` is built every night into a rolling
  `nightly` prerelease with all six platform artifacts; the in-app update
  check is prerelease-aware so nightly users ride the channel while stable
  users never see it. (#114, #116)
- **Sidebar groups tabs by git repository** — vertical tabs cluster under a
  repo header, groups persist across restarts, ⌘N numbering follows visual
  order, and same-named repos are disambiguated by their parent directory.
  (#110)
- **System tray icon with agent status menu** — a tray/menu-bar icon
  summarizes agent activity across sessions and jumps to a pane from its
  menu. (#105, #109)
- **Gradient and image theme backgrounds** — themes can render gradient or
  image backgrounds with global window opacity and blur, hot-reloaded like
  the rest of the theme. (#106)
- **Double-click a tab to zoom the window** — matching titlebar behavior;
  rename moved to the context menu. (#103)

### Changed

- **Settings sheet refinements** — controls right-align in their rows with
  hover feedback, the column is tighter, and the theme card is richer.
  (#108)
- **Settings copy polish** — clearer wording throughout, and the SSH
  security defaults stay visible instead of hiding behind a toggle. (#104)

### Fixed

- **Ctrl+C after a copy sends SIGINT again** — copying with Ctrl+C and
  pasting to the PTY now consume the selection, so the next Ctrl+C reaches
  the program instead of copying the same text twice. (#113)
- **Shell vi mode is supported** — vi-mode prompts are detected via durable
  signals and no longer confuse the prompt gap hold. (#102, thanks @ayamir)
- **App cursor shape is respected** — programs that set the cursor shape
  (e.g. vim) see it honored. (#101, thanks @ayamir)

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Per-tab context menu with worktree tabs** — right-clicking a tab chip or
  sidebar row opens a menu: rename, splits, copy working directory, and a
  close group. *New Worktree Tab* creates a git worktree under the repo's own
  `.tty7/worktrees/<name>` (kept out of `git status` by a self-ignoring
  `.gitignore`), with editable name / branch / start point and a live path
  preview. Closing a tab that sat in a managed worktree offers to remove the
  checkout — unless another pane still lives in it, and dirty checkouts
  default to keeping. (#96)
- **Unread pane count in the tab status dot** — a split tab can finish
  several agent turns while you're away; the green Done dot now swells into
  a badge counting the unread panes (clamped at 9) and shrinks back once
  every pane has been seen. (#98)

### Changed

- **The sidebar diff overlay is per-tab and side-by-side** — the overlay now
  lives on its tab: switching away hides it, switching back restores it
  (re-probing when the status cache disagrees), closing the tab drops it,
  and Esc keeps working. The body switches from a unified diff to a
  GitHub-PR-style side-by-side view with positionally aligned
  removed / added columns. (#100)
- **macOS-style popup panels** — menus get a rounded pill highlight, inset
  hairline separators, a 10px panel radius, and a floatier shadow;
  searchable lists get a taller Spotlight-style search row, and the palette
  viewport holds a whole number of rows so the last visible row is never
  cut mid-height. (#97)
- **README rewritten as a minimal index** — feature details, keybindings,
  and performance notes moved to `docs/features.md` (en + zh-CN); the
  tagline now positions tty7 as a terminal workbench.

### Fixed

- **The agent dot no longer sticks on Waiting after you approve a
  permission** — Claude Code has no "permission replied" hook, so a new
  PostToolUse hook emits a tool-complete event and the first tool that
  finishes after approval flips the dot back to Working. Existing hook
  installs surface as Outdated in Settings → Agents with an Update
  button. (#99)

## [0.16.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **Sidebar diff overlay only opens from the `+N`/`−N` counts** — clicking
  anywhere on a tab row's git line (branch icon, branch name) used to toggle
  the diff overlay, hijacking ordinary clicks on the lower half of the row.
  Now only the diff counts are the click target; the rest of the line
  activates the tab like the rest of the row. (#95)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **Click a sidebar git line to open a working-tree diff overlay** — the
  branch/diff row in the sidebar is now clickable and opens an in-app overlay
  showing the working-tree diff against `HEAD`, file by file with expandable
  hunks. It rides the shared git-status signal: when fresh numbers land that
  disagree with what it shows, it re-probes the full diff so the overlay stays
  live. (#92)
- **Window size and position are remembered across launches** — tty7 saves
  the window geometry on quit and restores it next launch, re-centering if the
  saved bounds no longer overlap any display. Can be toggled off with the
  `remember_window_size` config key. (#94)

### Fixed

- **Attach replay no longer duplicates TUI output into scrollback** — the
  daemon's replay ring is now segmented by the geometry its bytes were
  recorded under, and attach replays a `Size` → `Snapshot` pair per segment.
  Previously the whole ring replayed at the final PTY width, so any resize
  during a session (a pane split, a window drag) re-wrapped older output and
  a TUI's cursor-up redraws (Claude Code's inline renderer, most visibly)
  landed mid-frame, flooding the reattached pane's scrollback with stale
  frame copies that never existed live. The ring also caps its segment count
  so a long-lived session with many resizes can't grow it without bound. (#91)
- **Agent hooks no longer hang when stdin is a terminal** — the hook runner
  skips the stdin read when fd 0 is a tty, so a hook invoked interactively
  (rather than with a piped payload) emits the bare event instead of blocking
  forever on a read that never returns. (#93)

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **Daemon protocol version handshake** — the GUI asks a running daemon
  which wire protocol it speaks before reusing it; after an app upgrade a
  mismatched daemon is kept alive and a prompt offers Keep Sessions or
  Restart Daemon instead of silently killing every persisted session. (#90)

### Changed

- **Tab close affordance** hides until hover on the active tab too, so the
  sidebar and tab strip read clean. (#90)
- **Command palette** no longer offers the Claude-only hook install entry;
  Settings → Agents owns hook installs with per-agent state.

### Fixed

- **SSH connection state** shows as a corner status dot on the tab avatar
  (amber connecting, green connected, red failed) in the same semantic
  colors as agent dots, replacing a theme-grey border ring that read as no
  state at all. (#90)
- **Sidebar git branch/diff line** is shared per repository: panes in one
  work tree read one snapshot refreshed by whichever pane probed last, so
  rows for the same directory no longer show stale or missing +/− counts.
  (#90)
- **Command palette** no longer pins Connect/Save rows above command
  matches for bare words like `java`; QuickConnect rows require a
  host-like query (`@`, `:` or `.`). (#90)

## [0.15.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Per-agent hook integrations (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot CLI, OpenCode,
  Pi) with install state and actions in Settings → Agents. (#87)
- CLI coding agents and the git branch are recognized and shown in the
  sidebar. (#85)
- Multi-line prompt editor, plus an I-beam mouse pointer over text. (#80)
- SSH: Unix GSSAPI (Kerberos) authentication. (#81)

### Changed

- Splitting an SSH pane opens another SSH pane on the same host. (#83)

### Fixed

- The grid shifts up when wrapped command input overflows the bottom of
  the screen, keeping the caret visible. (#86)
- Each tab keeps its own active pane across tab switches. (#84)
- The theme panel stays on-screen on narrow windows. (#82)

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- SSH loopback forwarding for links. (#58)
- Editable keybindings: rebindable shortcuts, pane/tab actions, and a tmux
  preset. (#65)

### Fixed

- Trim the first tab's left gap flush to the traffic-light reserve. (#62)

### Added

- Ship a Linux AppImage alongside the tarball. (#55)
- Title-bar overflow menu for the command palette and settings. (#57)

### Changed

- Redesigned theme picker with a slide-in panel. (#56)

### Fixed

- Stop the title-bar strip from clipping the Windows close button. (#60)
- Restore the original terminal-window logo, reverting the branding
  change. (#59)

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- File-based themes, an in-app theme editor, and a UI/branding refresh. (#54)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Tab completion now executes the completion specs' *dynamic generators*:
  positions whose candidates come from the live system get real values — git
  branches on `git checkout <Tab>`, container names for docker/podman,
  `package.json` scripts for npm/pnpm/bun/yarn, cargo/rustup/tmux/brew/apt/pip
  listings, and more. Scripts run off the main thread in the session's cwd
  (800 ms timeout, output capped, short-lived cache) and their results merge
  into the already-open menu as they arrive; a slow or failing generator just
  contributes nothing. (#52)
- When shell integration never engages in a pane, pressing Ctrl+R now explains
  why the history menu can't appear (once per pane, dismissed by the next
  keystroke) instead of failing silently — naming the wrapper when a
  figterm-style PTY shim (`kiro-cli-term`, `figterm`, `qterm`) is intercepting
  the shell's OSC 133 reports. The chord still reaches the shell, so its own
  reverse-i-search keeps working. (#46)

### Fixed

- `ssh <Tab>` (and scp/sftp/rsync) now completes host aliases from
  `~/.ssh/config` — `Include` files honored, wildcard patterns skipped — and
  hosts from `known_hosts`, instead of falling back to listing the current
  directory. (#51)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- Ctrl+R history search is now a browsable menu: matching is fuzzy
  (subsequence with word-boundary/consecutive bonuses; space-separated terms
  must all match) blended with frecency, and the ranked candidates float
  beside the prompt — matched characters highlighted, selection moved by
  Ctrl+R/↓ and Ctrl+S/↑, Enter to edit, Cmd+Enter to run outright. An empty
  query lists the whole history by frecency, so bare Ctrl+R is a "recent &
  relevant" browser. The classic `(reverse-i-search)` line stays. (#45)
- History records now carry when the command ran and its exit code: new
  entries are `<ts>\t<exit>\t<cwd>\t<command>`, written when the command
  *finishes* (zsh `INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME`-style, exit code sniffed from
  OSC 133;D daemon-side); older formats still load. The Ctrl+R menu shows
  "ran 3h ago" and a `✗` badge on commands whose last run failed; timestamps
  from zsh/bash history files are carried over when seeding. (#45)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Copy on select: an opt-in Settings → Terminal → Clipboard toggle (config
  key `copy_on_select`) that copies a mouse selection — drag, double-click
  word, or triple-click line, over terminal output or the prompt's command
  editor — to the clipboard the moment the gesture ends, no ⌘C needed. Off
  by default so a stray selection never overwrites the clipboard. (#34)

### Fixed

- The held-⌘ tab-number badges no longer stick on after the window loses key
  status mid-hold (⌘-Tab, Spotlight, a click into another app). The ⌘ release
  goes to whatever app is key by then, so the window never saw it; the badges
  — and any pending reveal — are now dismissed on the activation flip itself.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Terminal ANSI colors (`color0`–`color15`) can now be overridden individually
  via `ansi_colors.*` in `config.json`, layered on top of the active theme
  preset — with a color picker per slot under Settings → Appearance → ANSI
  Colors. Malformed values are ignored, and clearing an override falls back to
  the preset's palette. (#37)

- Font ligatures can now be enabled for terminal text. A new optional
  `font_features` config passes OpenType features (e.g. `{"calt": true}`)
  through to the renderer, and Settings → Appearance grows a toggle for the
  common `calt`/`liga` pair. Ligatures stay disabled by default for cell-grid
  safety, and changes hot-apply to open panes. (#38)

### Fixed

- Ctrl+L now clears the screen while the prompt-local line editor is active.
  The readline dispatcher used to swallow it as an unrecognized chord; it now
  forwards the same form-feed byte the raw terminal path sends, so the shell
  repaints its prompt as expected. (#36)

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- Context menus and the "+" dropdown now highlight the hovered row with the
  same soft fill the command palette uses for its selected row, instead of the
  stock saturated accent that snapped hard against the rest of the UI. The
  hover text stays at the normal foreground so it reads clearly on the quieter
  fill.

### Fixed

- On Windows, a pane no longer hangs open when its shell exits on its own.
  Typing `exit`, pressing Ctrl-D, or a shell crash ends the shell, but ConPTY's
  output pipe never reports EOF on a natural exit — and tty7 detected a shell's
  death solely from that EOF — so the pane was left wedged open, dead but
  visible. A Windows-only monitor now waits on the shell process directly and
  reports the exit through the same path a Unix `read()` EOF drives, so the pane
  closes as it does everywhere else. Closing a tab from the UI was already
  unaffected; macOS and Linux are unchanged. (#30)

- Nerd Font prompt icons no longer render sliced off on the right. A non-Mono
  Nerd Font (and the proportional `➜`/`❯` the OS cascade hands back when nothing
  in your font list covers them) gives an icon a single-cell *advance* but draws
  ink up to ~1.9 cells wide, and tty7 clipped every lone glyph to exactly one
  cell — severing the overflow into the half-icons and cut-off arrow from the
  report. A single glyph now paints into a two-cell window, so it renders whole
  (bleeding into the trailing blank the way iTerm2 and Terminal.app do), bounded
  at two cells so a stray face can't smear across the row. Pairs with the native
  powerline separators from #19; Mono Nerd Fonts are unchanged. (#17)

- New tabs and splits no longer stall for seconds while a zsh plugin manager
  reinstalls itself. tty7 launches zsh through a throwaway `ZDOTDIR` (so it can
  layer its shell integration on top of your config), but it used to leave
  `ZDOTDIR` pointing at that empty temp dir the whole time — so tools that find
  their own state via `${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}` (Zim, oh-my-zsh, `compinit`'s
  `.zcompdump`) looked in the wrong place and rebuilt from scratch on every
  pane, e.g. Zim reprinting `modules/…: Installed` and hanging for ~3s. Each
  redirector now points `ZDOTDIR` back at your real config dir while your
  startup files run, and restores it for the live session, so plugin managers
  and completion caches resolve correctly and load instantly. As a bonus this
  also fixes the classic relocated-config layout (a tiny `~/.zshenv` that sets
  `ZDOTDIR=~/.config/zsh`), which previously loaded your config but silently
  dropped tty7's integration. (#15)

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- Tab completion (and other line editing) now stays out of the way over `ssh`.
  A remote shell that emits its own prompt marks — fish 4.x on a Linux server,
  most visibly, which ships OSC 133 on by default — used to engage tty7's
  *local* line editor, so Tab ran completion against the local machine's
  filesystem instead of reaching the remote shell. tty7 now only drives the
  inline editor while the shell it launched is itself idle at its prompt;
  whenever a foreground command (ssh, a TUI, a nested shell) owns the terminal,
  keystrokes pass straight through to it. (#26, follow-up to #18)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- The "+" button now opens a shell picker: tty7 detects the shells installed
  on this machine (on Unix the login shell, `/etc/shells`, plus well-known
  shells found on `PATH` — fish, nushell, pwsh and friends installed by
  Homebrew/nix are never registered in `/etc/shells`; on Windows PowerShell 7,
  Windows PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash and WSL distributions)
  and lists them in a dropdown, so opening a tab in a different shell
  no longer requires editing `config.json`. The default entry leads the menu,
  ⌘T / Ctrl+T still opens a default tab in one keystroke, and splitting a pane
  inherits its shell — a fish tab splits into more fish, not back to the
  default. Shells picked this way aren't remembered across restarts (restored
  panes re-attach to their still-running shells anyway).

### Changed

- The Windows default shell now prefers PowerShell 7 (`pwsh.exe`) when
  installed — probed across Program Files (x64/x86/ARM), the Microsoft Store,
  scoop, dotnet tools and `PATH` — and falls back to Windows PowerShell as
  before. Set `shell` in `config.json` to override, as ever.

### Fixed

- Powerline prompt separators (powerlevel10k, oh-my-posh, oh-my-zsh) now render
  pixel-perfect at any font, size and line-height: the eight solid separators
  (sharp triangles, round caps, slants) are drawn natively as fill paths sized
  to the exact cell instead of relying on a Nerd Font, so segments meet their
  backgrounds cleanly with no gaps, narrow wedges or tofu. The bundled Hack font
  is also appended to every font-fallback chain, so common prompt glyphs (➜, ❯,
  box drawing) no longer render truncated or missing when no Nerd Font is
  installed. (#17)
- A URL glued directly to a full-width bracket with no space — e.g.
  `…/pull/343（fix/… → dev）` — no longer swallows the bracket text into the
  link. URL detection now stops at the first non-URL character (a CJK glyph,
  full-width bracket, arrow or emoji), while interior ASCII parens
  (Wikipedia-style URLs) are still preserved.
- Fish, nushell, pwsh and other shells installed by Homebrew or nix now appear
  in the "+" shell picker even when they aren't registered in `/etc/shells`
  (which those package managers leave to the user): a curated set of well-known
  shells is now probed on `PATH` as a catch-all, after the `/etc/shells`
  entries. (#18)
- Upgrading tty7 while an older daemon is still running in the background no
  longer breaks new tabs. A stale daemon that accepts the connection but can't
  serve the new client's request is now restarted once and retried
  automatically; on macOS the GUI also forwards the shell it was launched with
  to the detached daemon, so panes use the right shell instead of a stale
  `$SHELL` inherited from LaunchServices.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Windows releases now ship an Inno Setup installer
  (`tty7-<version>-windows-x86_64-setup.exe`) alongside the portable zip. It
  installs per-user by default (no admin prompt, with an all-users option),
  adds a Start Menu shortcut and an "Apps" uninstall entry, and offers an
  optional desktop icon. Still unsigned, so SmartScreen warns on first launch.
- Startup update check: tty7 asks GitHub once, in the background, whether a
  newer release has shipped. If so, it pops a one-time "Update available" dialog
  (once per version — remembered in `update.json`, so it never nags twice for
  the same release) and keeps a persistent "Download" prompt in Settings →
  About. Both open the Releases page; tty7 never downloads or updates itself —
  you still install by hand. Turn the check off with `check_for_updates` in
  `config.json` or the "Check for updates on launch" toggle in About. A failed
  or offline check is silent.
- ⌘K (Ctrl+K on Windows/Linux) clears the screen and scrollback — the same
  "Clear" the right-click menu already offered, now on the keyboard shortcut
  Terminal.app, iTerm2, and Ghostty users expect. Also available from the
  command palette, and remappable as `ClearScrollback` in `keybindings`.
- ⌘⏎ toggles window fullscreen (new `ToggleFullscreen` action, also in the
  View menu and command palette), matching the Ghostty/iTerm2 default. It
  previously toggled pane maximize — which silently did nothing in a
  single-pane tab, so the chord felt dead.
- The right-click menu now shows each item's keyboard shortcut. Copy, Paste,
  Select All, and Find previously showed nothing (they're dispatched inline,
  with no bound key for the menu to read a hint from) while the other items
  did, so the menu looked half-labelled. ⌘A / ⌘F stay hint-less on
  Windows/Linux, where those chords keep their readline meaning.

### Changed

- Maximize / restore pane moved from ⌘⏎ to ⌘⇧⏎ (Ghostty's `toggle_split_zoom`
  default), making room for fullscreen on the bare chord. An existing
  `ToggleMaximizePane` override in `keybindings` still wins.

### Fixed

- Windows: launching tty7 no longer opens a stray console window behind the
  app. Release builds are now linked with the `windows` subsystem; debug
  builds keep the console so `println!` output stays visible. (#10)
- The right-click "Select All" now matches the ⌘A shortcut: at the prompt it
  selects the edited command line, otherwise the whole terminal buffer. It
  previously always selected the whole buffer, so click and keystroke behaved
  differently at the prompt.
- Ctrl+R reverse-search now accepts plain ASCII keystrokes. The query only
  took text from the IME commit path, so a non-CJK input source on macOS — and
  all typing on Linux — was swallowed: the search box opened but ate every key.
  Reported on V2EX.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- PowerShell shell integration: `powershell.exe` and `pwsh` now emit the OSC 133
  semantic-prompt marks and OSC 7 cwd that zsh/bash/fish already do, injected
  via `-EncodedCommand` after the user's profile loads (their config is never
  touched). This turns on the inline line editor at the PowerShell prompt — so
  clicking positions the caret and new tabs/splits inherit the working
  directory — which is what previously made mouse clicks a no-op at the prompt
  on Windows.

### Fixed

- Typing `exit` (or Ctrl-D) left a dead "process exited" pane behind instead
  of closing it. A pane whose shell genuinely ends now closes itself —
  collapsing its split, or closing the tab when it was the only pane (the
  last tab falls back to the home page), like every other terminal. A pane
  that merely *lost its daemon connection* still stays visible: auto-closing
  those would silently discard — and kill — sessions that may still be alive
  daemon-side. Panes that died while detached clean themselves up on the next
  attach the same way.

- A full-screen TUI dying without restoring the terminal — the canonical case
  being an ssh session dropping mid-`htop`/`vim` — left the pane stranded on
  the alt screen with a hidden cursor and live mouse reporting: a visible
  prompt with no cursor anywhere, mouse clicks echoing `0;19;42M`-style junk,
  and broken scrollback. The client now scrubs this residue the moment the
  shell reports its next prompt (OSC 133): it leaves the stranded alt screen,
  re-shows the DECTCEM-hidden cursor, and disables stale mouse/focus reporting
  and kitty keyboard flags — each reset only when its mode is actually set.
  Reattach self-heals the same way, since the daemon replays the prompt state
  after the ring.

- Windows shell integration never engaged even for the default shell: detection
  keyed off `portable-pty`'s `get_shell()`, which reports `%ComSpec%` (cmd.exe)
  regardless of what's actually spawned, so the PowerShell default was mistaken
  for an unsupported shell. It now resolves to `powershell.exe` directly.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Underline styles: undercurl, double, dotted, and dashed underlines render distinctly.
- `config.json` hot reload — edits apply to the running app without a restart.
- Desktop notifications driven by OSC 9 / OSC 777 escape sequences.
- Kitty keyboard protocol (CSI u progressive enhancement) for TUI apps like Neovim and Helix.
- Shell integration for bash and fish, alongside the existing zsh support.
- Windows support: cross-platform daemon, PowerShell as the default shell, embedded app icon.
- Linux support: builds against gpui's x11/wayland backends, `/proc`-based foreground cwd + pane-title tracking, Linux CI job, and documented build dependencies.
- Downloadable builds for every platform: the release workflow now packages and uploads all four targets — signed/notarized macOS DMGs (arm64 + x86_64) plus unsigned archives for Windows (`.zip`) and Linux (`.tar.gz`), each via its own `.github/scripts/bundle-<os>` script.
- Settings UI: terminal / appearance / behavior options are configurable from the GUI, with a searchable font-family dropdown and a wider theme gallery.
- Configurable default shell.

### Changed

- Project renamed to **tty7**.
- macOS releases ship as drag-to-Applications DMGs instead of zips, and the
  Intel build moved to the `macos-15-intel` runner (`macos-13` was retired,
  which had silently kept x86_64 assets from ever publishing).
- Pixel-smooth scrollback: scrolling carries a sub-line fraction and shifts the paint instead of jumping whole lines.
- Smoother scrolling on dense screens: glyph shaping is batched and wakeups are coalesced.
- CJK-dense screens paint ~2.4× faster: consecutive wide glyphs batch into single shaped runs (two columns per glyph) instead of painting cell-by-cell; the grid snapshot buffer is reused across frames and the selection/search overlay scans are skipped when nothing is highlighted. Release builds now use thin LTO.
- Type-ahead is integrated into the line editor instead of being stranded on zle's line.
- New tabs open next to the active tab instead of at the end.
- Terminal throughput ~12× faster (11 MB `cat`: ~2.0 s → ~0.16 s; DOOM-fire: ~47 fps → ~920 fps, both at 155×40 on an M1 Pro — now ahead of Alacritty/Ghostty on the same machine): the daemon's replay ring is a `VecDeque` so a full ring no longer memmoves 8 MiB per ~1 KiB PTY read, and the per-connection writer coalesces queued `Output` frames (≤256 KiB) so a flood reaches the client as a few large frames instead of thousands of tiny ones. A backpressure gate (4 MiB high-water) pauses the PTY reader while the client catches up, so a runaway `yes` can't grow daemon memory without bound. `TTY7_TRACE=1` prints per-second reader-loop accounting on both sides for future diagnosis.
- Second throughput pass, another ~1.4× on bulk output (11 MB `cat`: ~160 ms → ~100 ms; sustained plaintext drain 124 → 148 MB/s, vs ~170 MB/s for a raw do-nothing PTY reader on the same machine; DOOM-fire is unchanged — it is producer-bound at ~96 MB/s): the backpressure high-water grows to 16 MiB so a big burst drains at PTY speed while the client parses in its own time; daemon⇄GUI socket buffers grow from macOS's 8 KiB default to 256 KiB; the client applies consecutive `Output` frames as one batched parser pass (one term-lock + wakeup per burst, latency-free — the batch never waits for unarrived bytes); the shared OSC tokenizer skips Ground/Ignore runs with SIMD `memchr`; the gate's hot path is a lock-free atomic (previously a Mutex plus an unconditional `notify_all` per socket write); and the four threads on the interactive output path ask macOS for `USER_INTERACTIVE` QoS to stay off the efficiency cores (`TTY7_NO_QOS=1` opts out).

### Fixed

- A long `--config-dir` path crashed the GUI at startup ("path must be shorter than SUN_LEN"): when `<config>/daemon.sock` would exceed the OS socket-path limit (104 bytes on macOS), the endpoint now falls back to a short per-user path keyed by a stable hash of the config dir ($XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, else the OS temp dir). Short paths keep the original layout, so existing daemons stay reachable.
- Typing right after a command finished could leave a stray echoed character plus zsh's reverse-video `%` in the scrollback: the "command finished" mark (OSC 133;D) is now emitted the instant the command exits — prepended ahead of the user's precmd hooks (zsh/bash) — instead of after slow prompt frameworks (oh-my-zsh git status, conda), so the local input editor takes keystrokes back hundreds of milliseconds sooner.
- Typing while a command was still running stranded those keystrokes on zle's line at the next prompt — un-editable and double-drawn under the line editor's overlay. Type-ahead adoption (wipe the shell's line, seed the editor) now runs at every prompt, not just the shell's first, and the wipe waits until zle is actually reading (the live `133;B` mark) so it is consumed silently instead of being kernel-echoed into the scrollback as a literal `^U`.
- Typing ahead of a fast command left kernel-echoed debris in the scrollback (`ls` plus zsh's reverse-video `%`). Reconstructable gap input is now held client-side for up to 150 ms: a command that finishes inside the window hands the keystrokes straight to the line editor with the PTY untouched — zero echo; a longer command (or one reading stdin) gets the bytes released verbatim, so REPLs and password prompts still work.
- fish shell integration silently never installed, so fish users got no prompt marks or cwd tracking.
- **Security:** pasted clipboard content is stripped of ESC bytes, closing a bracketed-paste escape that could inject auto-executing commands.
- Crash when copying/cutting right after a forward word/line delete left a stale selection anchor.
- `Ctrl+Alt+<letter>` was indistinguishable from `Ctrl+<letter>` because the legacy key encoder dropped the Alt ESC prefix.
- Plain Enter/Tab/Backspace were wrongly CSI-u-encoded at the kitty-keyboard DISAMBIGUATE level, which could wedge the shell after a crashed TUI.
- No-op edits (e.g. Backspace at the start of the line) no longer swallow the first undo.
- OSC scanners (daemon-side and notification-side) dropped a well-formed sequence that directly followed an unterminated one.
- Daemon pane teardown is hardened: process-group kill, bounded join, dead panes are reclaimed.
- New shells default to `$HOME` when launched from the app bundle with cwd `/`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30
